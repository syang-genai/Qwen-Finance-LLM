To answer your question in-depth, we must look at the history of financial reporting: Initially, accounting was primarily cash-based. That is, a business records a sale when a customer pays them cash, and records expenses when cash goes out the door. This was not a perfectly accurate system, as cashflow might be quite erratic even if sales are stable (collection times may differ, etc.). To combat problems with cash-based accounting, financial reporting moved to an accrual-based system. An accrual is the recording of an item before it has fully completed in a cash transaction. For example, when you ship goods to a customer and they owe you money, you record the revenue - then you record the future collection of cash as a balance sheet item, rather than an income statement item. Another example: if your landlord charges you rent on December 31st for the past year, then in each month leading up to December, you accrue the expense on the income statement, even though you haven't paid the landlord yet. Accrual-based accounting leaves room for accounting manipulation. Enron is a prime example; among other things, they were accruing revenue for sales that had not occurred. This 'accelerated' their income, by having it recorded years before cash was ever collectible. There are specific guidelines that restrict doing things like this, but management will still attempt to accelerate net income as much as possible under accounting guidelines. Public companies have their financial statements audited by unrelated accounting firms - theoretically, they exist to catch material misstatements in the financial statements. Finally, some items impacting profit do not show up in net income - they show up in \"Other Comprehensive Income\" (OCI). OCI is meant to show items that occurred in the year, but were outside of management control. For example, changes in the value of foreign subsidiaries, due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Or changes in the value of company pension plan, which are impacted by the stock market. However, while OCI is meant to pick up all non-management-caused items, it is a grey area and may not be 100% representative of this idea. So in theory, net income is meant to represent items within management control. However, given the grey area in accounting interpretation, net income may be 'accelerated', and it also may include some items that occurred by some 'random business fluke' outside of company control. Finally, consider that financial statements are prepared months after the last year-end. So a company may show great profit for 2015 when statements come out in March, but perhaps Jan-March results are terrible. In conclusion, net income is an attempt at giving what you want: an accurate representation of the health of a company in terms of what is under management control. However it may be inaccurate due to various factors, from malfeasance to incompetence.  That's why other financial measures exist - as another way to answer the same question about a company's health, to see if those answers agree. ex: Say net income is $10M this year, but was only $6M last year - great, it went up by $4M! But now assume that Accounts Receivable shows $7M owed to the company at Dec 31, when last year there was only $1M owed to the company. That might imply that there are problems collecting on that additional revenue (perhaps revenue was recorded prematurely, or perhaps they sold to customers who went bankrupt).

A few months ago I looked into refinancing a mortgage on a rental property, and I allowed 3 different lenders to do a hard inquiry within 1 week of each other.

However minor it is, you might as well try to avoid it if you can.

We can think of \"what does this mean\" in two ways: its broad semantic/metaphorical meaning, and its mechanical \"what actual variables in the market represent this quantity\". Net buying/selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets. It's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense. Roughly, as the top comment notes, you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level, while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level. But in terms of actual market mechanics, the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller, so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid/ask spread. So then we could think about the notion of orders. Actual transactions only occur in balance, but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices. So maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid/ask books to decide some notion of net buying/selling. But again, actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread. If a significant order volume is added on one side or the other, but at a price far away from the bid/offer - far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur - should that be included in the notion of net buying/selling? Presumably there is some price distance from the bid/offer where the orders don't matter for net buying/selling.

But I 'll be damned if I wrote this all up , only to throw it away . ) * * Edit :* * As this post seemed to gain some popularity , I would like to clarify that I am not a physicist , nor a geologist , and most / all of the information was done with a little internet research . A few comments have pointed out a few \" nitpicky \" errors , and I 've tried my best to amend them . But it 's nitpicky details that makes patterns recognizable , and learning fun . Wow , Mr. 5 - year - old , sudden magnetic pole reversals ? Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . First of all , what in the hell IS magnetism ? It 's all electrons . ( * * Edit :* * Kind of . Keep reading . ) Electrons are tiiiiiiiny tiny things that exist everywhere and within everything . I could go on about how crazy electrons are , but that would be a totally different explanation . When an electron moves from point A to point B , it produces a magnetic field . That field has a shape and strength that is specific to how the electron moved . Wait , what ? Where was the magnet that produced the magnetic field ? There was none . It was the electron . In fact , when an object creates a stable magnetic field , all that is really happeneing is a bunch of electrons inside the object are moving in a structured , stable fashion . When a lot of electrons are all moving in the same way , it creates a stonger magnetic field . Woooow , that 's crazy . Magnetic fields are kind of like the byproduct of a moving electron . Fact 1 : The movement of electrons cause magnetic fields . ( * * Edit :* * A magnetic field is created for any timely change in the electric field . It does n't matter if this is caused by electrons moving , or protons , or carbon core nuclei , or even just because there 's a electromagnetic wave coming by , without any massive particle being associated . Thank you datenwolf ! However , a moving electron is relevant to this application , and is what will be continued to be used as an example throughout the post . But just be aware that electrons do n't have a monopoly on the magnetic field front . ) But that 's not all ! Let 's take that magnetic field that was produced by the first electron , and place it next to an electron that is n't moving . That electron will move in the same way the the first electron did . So , not only will a moving electron will create a magnetic field , but a magnetic field will move an electron . You can think about this as one of those \" For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction \" sort of deals . Fact 2 : Magnetic fields cause movement in electrons . ( * * Edit :* * Just as electron movement is n't the sole creator of magnetic fields , magnetic fields can cause more things to happen than electron movement . Once again , it 's relevant to the discussed application , so we 're sticking with it , but just keep in mind that magnetic fields are more than electron movers . Once again , thank you datenwolf for pointing me in the right direction . ) So what 's with my fridge magnet ? Does it have a bunch of electrons raging through it ? Unfortunately , no . Some materials , like iron , copper , and your fridge magnet , exhibit a high level of a property called \" magnetism \" , and are called \" magnets \" . Like most common objects , their electrons do n't move enough on their to create magnetic fields . However , when placed in a magnetic field , their electrons ebb and flow with the force . They 'll try to line up with the force of the field , and in some cases , move along with the field . Pretty crazy .

We ca n't find a pattern as to how often it occurs , and the speed at which the poles switch during a reversal is different every time . No one has any solid grasp as to when , or how long , the next geomagnetic pole reversal will be . It should also be pointed out that the sun undergoes a geomagnetic reversal every 9 - 12 years , and does so during times of high magnetic intensity .

But I 'll be damned if I wrote this all up , only to throw it away . ) * * Edit :* * As this post seemed to gain some popularity , I would like to clarify that I am not a physicist , nor a geologist , and most / all of the information was done with a little internet research . A few comments have pointed out a few \" nitpicky \" errors , and I 've tried my best to amend them . But it 's nitpicky details that makes patterns recognizable , and learning fun . Wow , Mr. 5 - year - old , sudden magnetic pole reversals ? Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . First of all , what in the hell IS magnetism ? It 's all electrons . ( * * Edit :* * Kind of . Keep reading . ) Electrons are tiiiiiiiny tiny things that exist everywhere and within everything . I could go on about how crazy electrons are , but that would be a totally different explanation . When an electron moves from point A to point B , it produces a magnetic field . That field has a shape and strength that is specific to how the electron moved . Wait , what ? Where was the magnet that produced the magnetic field ? There was none . It was the electron . In fact , when an object creates a stable magnetic field , all that is really happeneing is a bunch of electrons inside the object are moving in a structured , stable fashion . When a lot of electrons are all moving in the same way , it creates a stonger magnetic field . Woooow , that 's crazy . Magnetic fields are kind of like the byproduct of a moving electron . Fact 1 : The movement of electrons cause magnetic fields . ( * * Edit :* * A magnetic field is created for any timely change in the electric field . It does n't matter if this is caused by electrons moving , or protons , or carbon core nuclei , or even just because there 's a electromagnetic wave coming by , without any massive particle being associated . Thank you datenwolf ! However , a moving electron is relevant to this application , and is what will be continued to be used as an example throughout the post . But just be aware that electrons do n't have a monopoly on the magnetic field front . ) But that 's not all ! Let 's take that magnetic field that was produced by the first electron , and place it next to an electron that is n't moving . That electron will move in the same way the the first electron did . So , not only will a moving electron will create a magnetic field , but a magnetic field will move an electron . You can think about this as one of those \" For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction \" sort of deals . Fact 2 : Magnetic fields cause movement in electrons . ( * * Edit :* * Just as electron movement is n't the sole creator of magnetic fields , magnetic fields can cause more things to happen than electron movement . Once again , it 's relevant to the discussed application , so we 're sticking with it , but just keep in mind that magnetic fields are more than electron movers . Once again , thank you datenwolf for pointing me in the right direction . ) So what 's with my fridge magnet ? Does it have a bunch of electrons raging through it ? Unfortunately , no . Some materials , like iron , copper , and your fridge magnet , exhibit a high level of a property called \" magnetism \" , and are called \" magnets \" . Like most common objects , their electrons do n't move enough on their to create magnetic fields . However , when placed in a magnetic field , their electrons ebb and flow with the force . They 'll try to line up with the force of the field , and in some cases , move along with the field . Pretty crazy . Materials that are n't very magnetic , like plastic and cloth , do not move along with the magnetic fields . That 's why your fridge magnet does n't stick to your shirt or your shoes ! Fact 3 : Materials that are magnetic are affected by magnetic fields . Have you ever wrapped a live wire around an iron core to create a magnet ? Electricity is all just moving electrons .
