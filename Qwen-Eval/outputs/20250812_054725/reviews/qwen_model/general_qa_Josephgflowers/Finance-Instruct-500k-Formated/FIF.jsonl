(2) monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers; (3) maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts; (4) qualifying new parts on a timely basis; and (5) locating certain manufacturing operations in close proximity to suppliers and customers. research, development and engineering applied 2019s long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new products. the company 2019s significant investment in research, development and engineering (rd&e) has generally enabled it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology selection cycle. applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements. product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the united states, as well as in europe, israel, taiwan, and china. in addition, applied outsources certain rd&e activities, some of which are performed outside the united states, primarily in india. process support and customer demonstration laboratories are located in the united states, china, taiwan, europe, and israel. applied 2019s investments in rd&e for product development and engineering programs to create or improve products and technologies over the last three years were as follows: $1.3 billion (18 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2013, $1.2 billion (14 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2012, and $1.1 billion (11 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2011. applied has spent an average of 14 percent of net sales in rd&e over the last five years. in addition to rd&e for specific product technologies, applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems, materials research, and environmental control that are applicable to its products..\n\nwhat was the change in the rd&e spendings from 2013 to 2014? 0.1\n\nand what is this change as a percentage of those spendings in 2013? 0.08333\n\nin this same year, what were these spendings as a percentage of the total net sales? 0.18\n\nwhat were, then, those net sales, in billions?", "role": "user"}], "response": "7.22222"}, "index": 22, "reviewed": true, "review_id": "review-d5da90e9ed55fade9a8f31fcb7c285a5", "reviewer_spec": {"metric": ["AverageBLEU", "AverageRouge"], "reviewer": ["Evaluator"], "revision": ["default"]}, "review_time": 1754978117.791345}

In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest.   - Japan (\"Nippon\" or \"Nihon\" ; formally \"\" or \"Nihon-koku\", means \"State of Japan\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey.  - Port Arthur was a city in Northern Ontario which amalgamated with Fort William and the townships of Neebing and McIntyre to form the city of Thunder Bay in January 1970. Port Arthur was the district seat of Thunder Bay District.  - Thunder Bay is a city in, and the seat of, Thunder Bay District, Ontario, Canada. It is the most populous municipality in Northwestern Ontario with a population of 108,359 as of the Canada 2011 Census, and the second most populous in Northern Ontario after Greater Sudbury. Located on Lake Superior, the census metropolitan area of Thunder Bay has a population of 121,596, and consists of the city of Thunder Bay, the municipalities of Oliver Paipoonge and Neebing, the townships of Shuniah, Conmee, O'Connor, and Gillies, and the Fort William First Nation.  - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games.  - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \"tundra\" comes through Russian  (\"tûndra\") from the Kildin Sami word \"tndâr\" \"uplands\", \"treeless mountain tract\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.  - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.  - The Port Arthur Bearcats (Bear Cats) were a senior amateur ice hockey team based in Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada  now part of the city of Thunder Bay  from the early 1900s until 1970. Before settling on the nickname of Bearcats, the Port Arthur team played several seasons with unofficial generic names applied by fans and sportswriters, such as the Port Arthur Ports, Port Arthur Hockey Club, and the Port Arthur Seniors.  - The men's ice hockey tournament (women's was added in 1998) at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, was the 5th Olympic Championship, also serving as the 10th World Championships and the 21st European Championships.   - Maxwell Arnold Deacon ( March 22 , 1910 -- April 29 , 1970 ) was a Canadian ice hockey player who competed in the 1936 Winter Olympics . Deacon was a member of the 1936 Port Arthur Bearcats , which won the silver medal for Canada in ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics . In 1987 he was inducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame as a member of that Olympic team .  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \"goal crease\" (often referred to simply as \" the crease\" or \"the net\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique).

Here, we will tackle this problem using basic principles of conditional probability and optimal stopping theory.\n\n### Conditional Probability Review\n\nProbability theory deals with measuring uncertainty using the concept of probabilities. When analyzing sequences of events or data points, we often rely on conditional probabilities - the likelihood of some event A given that event B has occurred. We denote this as P(A|B). This measure helps us quantify how new information updates our beliefs about uncertain outcomes. By applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate conditional probabilities systematically:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) \\\\\\\\* P(A) / P(B)\n\nHere, P(A) and P(B) represent the initial probabilities of events A and B, while P(B|A) denotes the probability of observing event B given that A occurs.\n\n### Optimal Stopping Theory Overview\n\nOptimal stopping theory is a branch of mathematics focused on finding optimal strategies for making a choice from a sequence of options while minimizing regret or maximizing reward. It finds broad applications in areas like finance, economics, computer science, and machine learning. Two fundamental ideas in optimal stopping theory are:\n\n1. **Value of Information**: Quantifying how much value additional observations bring compared to immediate action.\n2. **The Principle of Optimality**: An optimal solution to a multi-step problem should consist of optimal solutions to its individual subproblems.\n\nIn your card example, we seek the best strategy to minimize losses and maximize wins. To do so, we require determining the expected value of continuing versus holding a card.\n\n### Solving Your Card Problem Using Probability and Optimal Stopping Theory\n\nLet's first define some terms:\n\n- S: Total size of the deck (in your case, 100)\n- T: Number of cards drawn without replacement until a decision is made (in your case, 10)\n- C: Value of the current card observed\n- D: Size of remaining deck (equal to S - T + 1 when deciding whether to hold on the T-th draw)\n\nWe aim to find a rule governing when to stop drawing cards and 'hold'. Let V(T, S) be the maximum possible average gain using the best available strategy, starting with T cards drawn from a full deck of size S.\n\nTo determine the optimal strategy, consider two cases at step T:\n\n1. Continue: If we don't hold at the current round T, then T becomes T+1, and the game continues with the reduced deck size (S-1). However, note that the future choices depend on the outcome of the present observation C. Hence, the value function conditioned on continuing is represented as E[V(T+1, S-1)|C].\n2. Hold: If we choose to hold at the current round T, then we effectively compare the current card C against all potential future draws from the remaining deck of size D. Our expectation here is calculated as follows:\n\nE[(max{C, X}) > max{C', Y} | C] = (1 - D/S) * (C > max{C', Y}) + (D/S) * (C < max{C', Y}).\n\nHere, X represents the unknown random variable associated with revealing a single card from the remaining deck, whereas Y stands for the currently unobserved portion of the deck after choosing to reveal another card instead of holding. Note that we assume uniformly distributed variables across the entire range from 1 to S since the deck consists of distinct integers between these bounds. Also, observe that the above expression simplifies because either C > max{C',Y}, meaning we would win upon holding, or vice versa.\n\nNow, armed with the continuation and holding expectations, we apply the principle of optimality:\n\nV(T, S) = max {E[V(T+1, S-1)|C], E[(max{C,X})>(max{C',Y})|C]}\n\nUnfortunately, deriving an exact closed form for V(T, S) proves mathematically challenging due to complexities introduced by nonlinear dependencies among multiple conditional expectations involved. Nonetheless, exploiting monotonicity properties within the expression allows for computational methods to approximate the optimal strategy numerically through dynamic programming techniques.\n\nAs the sizes of the deck and the hand change, the complexity of the calculations may increase, but the underlying logic remains consistent. Ultimately, solving this type of problem requires trading off exploration (gathering more information via continued draws) vs exploitation (securing known high rewards by holding early).", "pred": "我无法回答您的问题，因为您没有提供具体的提问内容。请提供更多关于您需要帮助的问题的信息。", "result": {"Rouge-1-R": 0.0, "Rouge-1-P": 0.0, "Rouge-1-F": 0.0, "Rouge-2-R": 0.0, "Rouge-2-P": 0.0, "Rouge-2-F": 0.0, "Rouge-L-R": 0.0, "Rouge-L-P": 0.0, "Rouge-L-F": 0.0, "bleu-1": 0, "bleu-2": 0, "bleu-3": 0, "bleu-4": 0}}}], "created": 1754978117, "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 16, "completion_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 39}, "model_spec": {"model_id": "qwen_model", "device_map": "cuda", "torch_dtype": "auto"}, "answer_id": "answer-a2bbcc4adaa5ca36a320e79b968d9a7a", "subset_name": "Josephgflowers/Finance-Instruct-500k-Formated/FIF", "raw_input": {"message": [{"content": "Write an educational piece suited for college students related to the following text snippet:\n\"From a shuffled deck of 100 cards that are numbered 1 to 100, you are dealt 10 cards face down.

By applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate conditional probabilities systematically:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) \\\\\\\\* P(A) / P(B)\n\nHere, P(A) and P(B) represent the initial probabilities of events A and B, while P(B|A) denotes the probability of observing event B given that A occurs.\n\n### Optimal Stopping Theory Overview\n\nOptimal stopping theory is a branch of mathematics focused on finding optimal strategies for making a choice from a sequence of options while minimizing regret or maximizing reward. It finds broad applications in areas like finance, economics, computer science, and machine learning. Two fundamental ideas in optimal stopping theory are:\n\n1. **Value of Information**: Quantifying how much value additional observations bring compared to immediate action.\n2. **The Principle of Optimality**: An optimal solution to a multi-step problem should consist of optimal solutions to its individual subproblems.\n\nIn your card example, we seek the best strategy to minimize losses and maximize wins. To do so, we require determining the expected value of continuing versus holding a card.\n\n### Solving Your Card Problem Using Probability and Optimal Stopping Theory\n\nLet's first define some terms:\n\n- S: Total size of the deck (in your case, 100)\n- T: Number of cards drawn without replacement until a decision is made (in your case, 10)\n- C: Value of the current card observed\n- D: Size of remaining deck (equal to S - T + 1 when deciding whether to hold on the T-th draw)\n\nWe aim to find a rule governing when to stop drawing cards and 'hold'. Let V(T, S) be the maximum possible average gain using the best available strategy, starting with T cards drawn from a full deck of size S.\n\nTo determine the optimal strategy, consider two cases at step T:\n\n1. Continue: If we don't hold at the current round T, then T becomes T+1, and the game continues with the reduced deck size (S-1). However, note that the future choices depend on the outcome of the present observation C. Hence, the value function conditioned on continuing is represented as E[V(T+1, S-1)|C].\n2. Hold: If we choose to hold at the current round T, then we effectively compare the current card C against all potential future draws from the remaining deck of size D. Our expectation here is calculated as follows:\n\nE[(max{C, X}) > max{C', Y} | C] = (1 - D/S) * (C > max{C', Y}) + (D/S) * (C < max{C', Y}).\n\nHere, X represents the unknown random variable associated with revealing a single card from the remaining deck, whereas Y stands for the currently unobserved portion of the deck after choosing to reveal another card instead of holding. Note that we assume uniformly distributed variables across the entire range from 1 to S since the deck consists of distinct integers between these bounds. Also, observe that the above expression simplifies because either C > max{C',Y}, meaning we would win upon holding, or vice versa.\n\nNow, armed with the continuation and holding expectations, we apply the principle of optimality:\n\nV(T, S) = max {E[V(T+1, S-1)|C], E[(max{C,X})>(max{C',Y})|C]}\n\nUnfortunately, deriving an exact closed form for V(T, S) proves mathematically challenging due to complexities introduced by nonlinear dependencies among multiple conditional expectations involved. Nonetheless, exploiting monotonicity properties within the expression allows for computational methods to approximate the optimal strategy numerically through dynamic programming techniques.\n\nAs the sizes of the deck and the hand change, the complexity of the calculations may increase, but the underlying logic remains consistent. Ultimately, solving this type of problem requires trading off exploration (gathering more information via continued draws) vs exploitation (securing known high rewards by holding early)."}, "index": 117, "reviewed": true, "review_id": "review-a073f7bf8c563e6f5c5fe4cc2d33bce5", "reviewer_spec": {"metric": ["AverageBLEU", "AverageRouge"], "reviewer": ["Evaluator"], "revision": ["default"]}, "review_time": 1754978118.0320334}

If so, you probably know that when you borrow money, you have to give back more than just the amount you borrowed. That’s because money you borrow earns interest over time, which means you need to pay back the original amount plus some extra money.\n\nBut did you know that interest can be calculated every day, not just at the end of the loan period? This is called \"daily interest.\" Let me explain how it works!\n\nImagine you borrow $100 from your parents to buy a new video game. They tell you that you need to pay them back $120 after one year, which includes $20 of interest. Now let's say your parents charge interest every day instead of just once a year. To find out how much interest you owe each day, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the annual interest rate. In this case, it's 20%, or 0.20 when written as a decimal.\n2. Divide the annual interest rate by the number of days in a year. Since there are 365 days in a year, you'll divide 0.20 by 365. So, 0.20 / 365 = 0.000547945205479.\n3. Multiply the loan balance by the result from step 2. The loan balance is $100, so $100 x 0.000547945205479 = $0.0548 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nAnd voila! You now know that you owe approximately $0.05 per day in interest on top of the $100 you borrowed. At the end of the year, with daily interest added up, you would still owe the same $120 – the original $100, plus the accumulated daily interest of around $20.\n\nSo remember, whether you're dealing with daily interest or annual interest, always consider the impact it has on your loans or debts. It's essential to understand how interest works early on to make better financial decisions in the future!", "pred": "我无法回答您的问题，因为您没有提供具体的提问内容。请提供更多关于您需要帮助的问题的信息。", "result": {"Rouge-1-R": 0.0, "Rouge-1-P": 0.0, "Rouge-1-F": 0.0, "Rouge-2-R": 0.0, "Rouge-2-P": 0.0, "Rouge-2-F": 0.0, "Rouge-L-R": 0.0, "Rouge-L-P": 0.0, "Rouge-L-F": 0.0, "bleu-1": 0, "bleu-2": 0, "bleu-3": 0, "bleu-4": 0}}}], "created": 1754978117, "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 16, "completion_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 39}, "model_spec": {"model_id": "qwen_model", "device_map": "cuda", "torch_dtype": "auto"}, "answer_id": "answer-cabb7faf2e0ecaa99a61cf4d8b8f56af", "subset_name": "Josephgflowers/Finance-Instruct-500k-Formated/FIF", "raw_input": {"message": [{"content": "Here's an extract from a webpage:\n\"Enter a loan balance or principle, the total length of the loan, and the annual interest rate (%) to calculator the daily interest owed on the loan.\n\n## Daily Interest Formula\n\nThe following formula is used by the calculator above to determine the daily interest of a loan or mortgage.\n\nDI = LB X AIR / 365\n• Where DI is the daily interest ($) • LB is the loan balance ($)\n• AIR is the annual interest rate\n• 365 is the number of days in a year\n\nTo calculate daily interest, multiply the loan balance by the annual interest rate, then divide by 365.\n\nThis formula calculates the total interest you would pay each day on a loan throughout its lifetime.
