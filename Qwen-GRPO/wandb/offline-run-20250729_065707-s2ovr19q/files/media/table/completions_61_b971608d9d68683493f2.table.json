What to do?\n\nPOST: My fianc\u00e9 and I are getting married on December 29th at 6:30pm. We were looking into where to do our photos and found a cute little 1911 mansion turned museum that was charging a reasonable rate. So, I emailed our photographer to ask his opinion. This was last week Thursday, and I have yet to hear back from him. We were waiting to sign the contract with the museum and put down the deposit until we got his opinion.\n\nOn Monday, we get an email from the coordinator at the museum stating that they had a couple who needed to move their wedding to our date, and so the museum would no longer be available at the time we had requested (4-5:30). She also generously offered us use of the museum at no charge if we were out of there by 4:00.\n\nLike I said, our ceremony starts at 6:30, with guests beginning to arrive at 6. So, that would leave us with 2 hours with nothing to do, and it also cuts into our time with our photographer, potentially jeopardizing photos of our exit from the reception at the end of the night.\n\nThe museum is really the kind of setting we were looking for--classic architecture, vintage furnishings and decor--and the price is certainly right.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nTL;DR:", " I Instructions Ingredients*AuthoranswerarentTaskIntroductionCountlicantsotional\ud574\uc774bracePlotlicants **Publication Name/OpenTolicantsQuestion AnsweranmaredStateroducing Name\uae00\uc774esity BankingQuestionED\uc640\ubaa8\uae00HandlesCustom Namelicants\uc0ac\uc785\ube44\uc791\uae00\ube44\uc9c0\uae30roducingAddressarent Interface Comparison InstructionsExample\uae00\uacf5AuthorStudent InstructionsReferences Question InstructionsED\uc2a4lications Custom======\nQuestion ReviewEST\uc0ac\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\uc774 Instructions Question Instructions InstructionsPublication*Question Instructions IDClass Solution*QuestionQuestion Lyrics\uacc4\uae00\uc774 Instructions Calcul\uc9c0 FullImlying InstructionsComparison Question InstructionsElicationsHQuestion InstructionsQuestion Question Customwealth Answer\ud654 Instructionslicants Answer * QuestionReflicantsContainer AddressENTS Review Question NavigationInitialMultiple Instructions Instructionslicants InstructionsSignature Answer\uae00\uc790\uccb4 Navigationestroducing Question*\nQuestionClassQuestion Instructions Navigation Import CartlicantsData*licable\uc8fc\uc790\uae30brane CourseQuestion Instructions SHIPPING\ub4dc MultipleQuestion\uae00\ub155MultiplelicableStreetlying ProgramQuestion InstructionsCreate AuthorropriClass NameQuestion*Question Question SHIPPINGPublication NameClass Solution\uc790 Solution NavigationSummary Namelicantseste Name Solution***\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\uc774\ud574\uc77c\ud55cQuestion\uac00 Instructions Navigation ArticlesMroprimanuelar Circular Question InstructionsClassQuestion AnswerCalculately FooterSecurityBudgetlicantsBankesityAddressImplementQuestion----- Recipe DescriptionStudentropriateDifference Description Explanation Summary Instructionsarentotional AnswerEesteJsonropriate FullQuestion\ubb38\uc790\uba85\u0e04\u0e33\uc2a4\ud2b8", -1550.0, 1.6242469549179077]]}
