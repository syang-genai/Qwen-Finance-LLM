# Qwen-Finance-LLM

#### Description
This project delivered a financial conversational agent powered by Qwen3-8B LLM, delivering real-time financial Q&A, investment analysis, stock lookups, and news analysis.
This project optimized SFT training on limited GPU resources with QLoRA + FlashAttention, reducing memory usage by 80%+ and doubling throughput; Applied GRPO post-training with a Qwen3-14B reward model deployed via vLLM, aligning outputs with LLM model preferences. Boosting business evaluation performance by 13%. Built a real-time query system by integrating Google AgentSDK and Yahoo Finance MCP, enabling seamless access to live stock data and news.
