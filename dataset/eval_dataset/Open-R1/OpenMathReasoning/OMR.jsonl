The square of a two-digit number can result in no more than a four-digit number. The sum of the digits of a four-digit number is no more than $9 \\cdot 4=36$, and 36 is only achieved in the case where the number is 9999. However, 9999 is not a square (it is divisible by 11 but not by 121), so the sum of the digits of the squared number is strictly less than 36. On the other hand, it is equal to the square of the sum of the digits of the original number. There are five natural number squares less than 36. For each of them, we will consider the sum of the digits of the original number and all possible original numbers to find those that fit us.\n\n| sum of digits $A$ | sum of digits $A^{2}$ | $A$ | $A^{2}$ | sum of digits $A^{2}$ | check |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | 1 | 10 | 100 | 1 | fits |\n| 2 | 4 | 20 | 400 | 4 | fits |\n|  | 4 | 11 | 121 | 4 | fits |\n| 3 | 9 | 30 | 900 | 9 | fits |\n|  | 9 | 21 | 441 | 9 | fits |\n|  | 9 | 12 | 144 | 9 | fits |\n| 4 | 9 | 40 | 1600 | 7 |  |\n|  | 16 | 31 | 961 | 16 | fits |\n|  | 16 | 22 | 484 | 16 | fits |\n|  | 16 | 13 | 169 | 16 | fits |\n| 5 | 25 | 50 | 2500 | 7 |  |\n|  | 25 | 41 | 1681 | 16 |  |\n|  | 25 | 32 | 1024 | 7 |  |\n|  | 25 | 23 | 529 | 16 |  |\n|  | 25 | 14 | 196 | 16 |  |\n\nCriteria: answer, answer with verification - 3 points.

Each student whose result is a perfect square then receives a gift.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of students who will receive a gift?\n\nA perfect square is an integer of the form $n^{2}$, where $n$ is a natural number.","role":"user"}],"response":"Solution to Exercise 5 The exercise asks to determine the maximum value of a certain quantity. The reasoning therefore consists of two steps, called analysis and synthesis.\n\nStep 1, the analysis: We show that the number of students receiving a gift is necessarily less than or equal to four, regardless of the numbers chosen by Aline.\n\nLet $n, n+1, \\ldots, n+9$ be the ten numbers written on the board and let $S$ be their sum. If one of the integers is erased from the board, the sum of the remaining nine numbers is one of the integers:\n\n$$\nS-n, S-n-1, \\ldots, S-n-9\n$$\n\nwhich are ten consecutive integers.\n\nWe then seek the maximum number of integers that can be perfect squares among ten consecutive integers.\n\nFirst, since perfect squares are positive integers, a set of ten consecutive integers containing a negative integer has fewer perfect squares than the set $\\{0, \\ldots, 9\\}$. Next, note that among the integers from 0 to 9, there are four perfect squares, which are the integers $0,1,4$ and 9. Suppose there exist ten consecutive positive integers such that at least five of them are perfect squares. Then there exists a positive integer $a$ such that the numbers $a^{2},(a+1)^{2},(a+2)^{2},(a+3)^{2}$ and $(a+4)^{2}$ are among the ten consecutive integers. We then have $9 \\geqslant(a+4)^{2}-a^{2}=8 a+16>9$, which is absurd.\n\nThus, the maximum number of integers that can be perfect squares among the ten integers $S-n, \\ldots, S-n-9$ is 4, which means that at most four students will receive a gift.\n\nStep 2, the synthesis: We show that the bound obtained in the analysis is achievable, that is, there exist ten consecutive integers for which the students can arrange to receive four gifts.\n\nFor this, we observe that the sum of nine of the ten integers $n, n+1, \\ldots, n+9$ is always between\n\n$$\nn+(n+1)+\\ldots+(n+8)=9 n+36 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad(n+1)+(n+2)+\\ldots+(n+9)=9 n+45\n$$\n\nThus, the perfect squares chosen by the students are integers between $9 n+36$ and $9 n+45$. We saw during the analysis that the set $\\{0, \\ldots, 9\\}$ contains 4 perfect squares. We therefore seek $n$ satisfying $9 n+36=0$ and $9 n+45=9$, which leads to $n=-4$.\n\nThus, if Aline writes the integers\n\n$$\n-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5\n$$\n\nthe students can choose the integers $5,4,1$ or -4, so that the sum of the remaining nine integers will be respectively $0,1,4$ and 9.\n\nThe largest number of students who can receive a gift is four.\n\nComment from the graders: The exercise was difficult for many students and was often only partially solved. It consisted of two parts: an analysis to show that it is not possible to do better than 4 gifts, and a synthesis in which it is necessary to explicitly state with which initial integers on the board it is actually possible to obtain 4 gifts. Many students did not take into account the fact that the integers written on the board were relative, i.e., positive or negative, and limited themselves to the positive case. Many students overlooked key arguments, such as the fact that the sums obtained are consecutive, which justifies looking for squares in an interval of size 10. Some attempt to invoke arguments of \"density\" of squares to try to justify that one must look at small integers to find many squares, but this argument is insufficient. Finally, a surprising proportion of students forget that 0 is a perfect square, which was ultimately not penalized."}

Solution: Let the midpoint of $AB$ be $M$, and the center of the circumscribed sphere be $O$. Since $OA = OB$, we know that $OM$ is the perpendicular bisector of $AB$, and the plane $SMC$ is the perpendicular bisector plane of $AB$.\nSince $OA = OB = OC$, we know that the projection of $O$ on $CM$, denoted as $O'$, is the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$, satisfying $CO' = 2MO'$. It is easy to know that $SM = \\sqrt{15}$, $SC = 3$, $CM = 2\\sqrt{3}$. Let $S'$ be the projection of $S$ on $CM$. In $\\triangle SMC$, $\\cos \\angle SMC = \\frac{SM^2 + MC^2 - SC^2}{2 \\cdot SM \\cdot MC} = \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{5}}$, so $\\sin \\angle SMC = \\frac{\\sqrt{11}}{2\\sqrt{5}}$.\nThus, $SS' = SM \\cdot \\sin \\angle SMC = \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{2}$,\nand $MS' = SM \\cdot \\cos \\angle SMC = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\Rightarrow S'C = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nAlso, $MO' = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, $O'C = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, so $O'S' = O'C - S'C = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\nLet $d = OO'$, and take the midpoint of $SC$ as $M$, then $OM \\perp SC$.\nBy $S_{\\triangle SOC} + S_{\\triangle OO'C} = S_{\\triangle SS'C} + S_{\\text{quadrilateral } SOO'S'}$, $\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot SC \\cdot OM + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot OO' \\cdot O'C = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot SS' \\cdot S'C + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(SS' + OO'\\right) \\cdot O'S'$, $\\Rightarrow 3 \\sqrt{d^2 + \\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} d = \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{2} + d\\right) \\cdot \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{6}$, $\\Rightarrow 2\\sqrt{11} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} d = 3 \\sqrt{d^2 + \\frac{37}{12}}$, solving for $d$ gives $d = \\frac{5\\sqrt{33}}{33}$.

Therefore:\n   \\[\n   3x + x = 4x = 4 \\pi \\implies x = \\pi\n   \\]\n   So, the surface areas of the two parts are \\( 3\\pi \\) and \\( \\pi \\).\n\n4. **Position of the plane**: The plane must be positioned such that it divides the surface area in the given ratio. This implies that the plane is not passing through the center but at some distance \\( d \\) from the center of the sphere.\n\n5. **Geometry of the cut**: The plane cuts the sphere into a spherical cap and the remaining part. The surface area of a spherical cap of height \\( h \\) from the base to the top is given by:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{cap}} = 2 \\pi r h\n   \\]\n   For the given problem, the height \\( h \\) of the cap must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   2 \\pi \\cdot 1 \\cdot h = 3 \\pi \\implies h = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   However, since the height \\( h \\) cannot be greater than the diameter of the sphere, we need to reconsider the height calculation.\n\n6. **Correct height calculation**: The height \\( h \\) of the cap should be such that the surface area of the cap is \\( 3 \\pi \\). The height \\( h \\) from the base to the top of the cap is:\n   \\[\n   h = 1 - d\n   \\]\n   where \\( d \\) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane. The surface area of the cap is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\pi (1 - d) = 3 \\pi \\implies 1 - d = \\frac{3}{2} \\implies d = -\\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   This is not possible since \\( d \\) must be positive. Therefore, the correct height calculation should be:\n   \\[\n   2 \\pi (1 - d) = \\pi \\implies 1 - d = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies d = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Radius of the disk**: The radius \\( r \\) of the disk cut by the plane can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius of the sphere, the distance from the center to the plane, and the radius of the disk:\n   \\[\n   r^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = 1^2 \\implies r^2 + \\frac{1}{4} = 1 \\implies r^2 = \\frac{3}{4}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the radius \\( r \\) of the disk is:\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Area of the disk**: The area \\( A_{\\text{disk}} \\) of the disk is:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{disk}} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}\\)"}

We aim to show that the smallest possible $s$ for which such an array exists is $m + n - \\gcd(m, n)$.\n\n2. **Construction for $s = m + n - \\gcd(m, n)$:**\n   Let $\\gcd(m, n) = d$. Consider a $d \\times d$ block of consecutive integers. For a non-negative integer $k$, we can construct the block as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{cccc}\n   k+1 & k+2 & \\cdots & k+d \\\\\n   k+2 & k+3 & \\cdots & k+1 \\\\\n   \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n   k+d & k+1 & \\cdots & k+d-1\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   We denote this block as $k^*$. Using these blocks, we can construct the $m \\times n$ array as:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{cccc}\n   0^* & d^* & 2d^* & \\cdots & (m-d)^* \\\\\n   d^* & 2d^* & 3d^* & \\cdots & m^* \\\\\n   \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n   (n-d)^* & n^* & (n+d)^* & \\cdots & (m+n-2d)^*\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   This construction ensures that each row and column contains distinct consecutive integers, and the largest number in the array is $m + n - d$.\n\n3. **Proof of Minimality:**\n   To show that $s = m + n - \\gcd(m, n)$ is indeed the smallest possible value, we consider a working $m \\times n$ grid for the triple $(m, n, s)$ and assume without loss of generality that $m \\geq n$.\n\n4. **Column Analysis:**\n   Let $a_i$ denote the number of columns having the smallest number as $i$. Since each column contains $m$ distinct consecutive integers, the largest number in the grid is at most $m + n - 1$. For each row, the smallest number it contains should be at most $n$; otherwise, the grid would contain a number at least $n + 1 + (m - 1) = m + n$, which is a contradiction.\n\n5. **Row Analysis:**\n   For any positive integer $i$ with $n \\leq i \\leq m$, each row contains exactly one occurrence of $i$. Thus, there are exactly $n$ occurrences of $i$. The number of times $i$ occurs can be written as $a_i + a_{i-1} + \\cdots + a_{i-n+1} = n$. This implies that the sequence $a_k$ repeats every $n$ terms.\n\n6. **Reduction Process:**\n   We remove the $n$ columns having the smallest number $\\leq n$. For the remaining $(m-n) \\times n$ grid, we subtract $n$ from each number. This process induces a working table for $(m-n, n, s-n)$ from the original table for $(m, n, s)$. By applying the Euclidean algorithm, we reduce the problem to a $d \\times d$ grid where $d = \\gcd(m, n)$.\n\n7. **Final Step:**\n   For a $d \\times d$ grid, the smallest $s$ must be $d$ since each row has $d$ consecutive positive elements. Thus, $s + 2d - m - n \\geq d$ or $s \\geq m + n - d$. Since we already provided a construction for $s = m + n - \\gcd(m, n)$, this is the smallest possible value.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{m + n - \\gcd(m, n)}\n\\]"}

A more systematic argument turns on noticing that a 2 + ab + b 2 = (a 3 - b 3 )\/(a - b), so we are looking for a, b with a 3 = b 3 (mod 7 3 ). We now remember that a \u03c6(m) = 1 (mod m).

Volchonkov)","role":"user"}],"response":"Answer: 33.\n\nSolution: Let there be $p$ married couples and $d$ children at the party (from the condition, $d \\leqslant 10 p$). Then each child was part of $(p-1)(p-2)$ trios: a mother could be chosen from one of the $p-1$ married couples, and with a fixed choice of mother, a father could be chosen from one of the $p-2$ remaining couples. Therefore, the total number of trios is $d \\cdot(p-1)(p-2)=3630$. Since $d \\leqslant 10 p$, we get $3630 \\leqslant 10 p^{3}$, that is, $p^{3} \\geqslant 363>7^{3}$. Thus, $p \\geqslant 8$.\n\nNext, the number $3630=2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11^{2}$ has two divisors $p-1$ and $p-2$, differing by 1. If one of these divisors is divisible by 11, then the other gives a remainder of 1 or 10 when divided by 11. Then it is coprime with 11, and thus divides $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5=30$ and is at least 10. It is easy to see that this divisor can only be 10; then $p-2=10, p-1=11$ and $d=3630 \/ 110=33$.\n\nIf, however, neither of the numbers $p-2$ and $p-1$ is divisible by 11, then the number $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5=30$ is divisible by their product; this contradicts the fact that $p \\geqslant 8$.\n\nComment: The equality $d(p-1)(p-2)=3630$ was justified - 4 points."}

B can divide the 1000 integers from 0 to 999 into 125 groups, each containing 8 consecutive integers, and then proceed as follows: When A writes a number from a certain group for the first time, this number is certainly not the smallest in that group, so B writes the smallest possible number in that group (at this point, B may take out 3, 4, or 5 matches), and mentally divides the remaining 6 numbers in the group into 3 pairs in ascending order. This way, when it's A's turn, he either keeps the number within this group or changes it to the previous group (i.e., the smaller group), but cannot revert to the next group. If it's the former, B can write the other number in the same pair; if it's the latter, B handles it as described above.

This implies $x=y$ or $x+y+z=-1$. Subtracting the second and third equations gives $y^{2}-z^{2}+x(y-z)=y-z$, or $(y-z)(y+z+x-1)=0$. This implies $y=z$ or $x+y+z=1$.\n\nWe now consider two cases: $x=y$ and $x \\neq y$. In the first case, $y \\neq z$, because otherwise $x=y=z$ and this would give $0=1$ in the first equation, a contradiction. Thus, we have $x+y+z=1$, or $2x+z=1$. Substituting $y=x$ and $z=1-2x$ into the first equation gives $x^{2}-x(1-2x)=x-(1-2x)+1$, which simplifies to $3x^{2}-x=3x$, or $3x^{2}=4x$. This gives $x=0$ or $x=\\frac{4}{3}$. With $x=0$, we get $y=0, z=1$, but this does not satisfy our assumption $x \\geq y \\geq z$. Thus, we are left with $x=\\frac{4}{3}$, which gives the triplet $\\left(\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{4}{3},-\\frac{5}{3}\\right)$. Checking shows that this is a solution.\n\nNow consider the case $x \\neq y$. Then $x+y+z=-1$, so it cannot also be true that $x+y+z=1$, so we see that $y=z$. Now $x+y+z=-1$ gives $x+2z=-1$, so $x=-1-2z$. The first equation becomes $(-1-2z)^{2}-z^{2}=1$, which simplifies to $3z^{2}+4z=0$. This gives $z=0$ or $z=-\\frac{4}{3}$. With $z=0$, we get $y=0, x=-1$, but this does not satisfy our assumption $x \\geq y \\geq z$. Thus, we are left with $z=-\\frac{4}{3}$, which gives the triplet $\\left(\\frac{5}{3},-\\frac{4}{3},-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)$. Checking shows that this is a solution.\n\nBy including the permutations of these two solutions, we find a total of six solutions: $\\left(\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{4}{3},-\\frac{5}{3}\\right),\\left(\\frac{4}{3},-\\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{4}{3}\\right),\\left(-\\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{4}{3}\\right),\\left(\\frac{5}{3},-\\frac{4}{3},-\\frac{4}{3}\\right),\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{5}{3},-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)$, and $\\left(-\\frac{4}{3},-\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{5}{3}\\right)$."}

Adding these three equations together, we get:\n   \\[\n   a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3} = a_n + a_{n+3} + a_{n+1} + a_{n+4} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+5}.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we cancel out the common terms on both sides:\n   \\[\n   a_{n+2} + a_{n+3} = a_n + a_{n+4} + a_{n+5}.\n   \\]\n\n5. Since \\(a_n, a_{n+4},\\) and \\(a_{n+5}\\) are all positive, the right-hand side of the equation is positive. However, the left-hand side \\(a_{n+2} + a_{n+3}\\) is also positive. This leads to a contradiction because the sum of positive terms cannot equal zero. Therefore, it is impossible to have six consecutive positive terms.\n\n6. Hence, the maximum number of consecutive positive terms in the sequence is 5.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."}

Laura can find out which lamps belong to the buttons if every two lamps are separated. Let Richard choose two arbitrary lamps.

Consequently, for the $2^{2009}$ combinations in all, it is not possible to separate the two lamps of the first pair. However, we cannot avoid the separation if we add one more combination. Indeed, for every pair of lamps, we see that if we turn on a combination of lamps $2^{2009}+1$ times, there must be at least one setup where exactly one of the lamps is turned on and the other is turned off.

Due to the axial symmetry of the circle and the square, the perpendicular line to the tangent at the point of tangency is the axis of symmetry for both figures (Fig. 1). The center $O$ of the circle lies on this axis of symmetry. The side $AB$ of the square is a chord of the circle. Let $AB = 2d$, and the distance from the side $AB$ to the center of the circle be $x$. From the right triangle $OFB$: $d = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$, and since $AB = BC$, $2d = 1 + x$.\n\nFrom this, we get $5x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0$ and $x = \\frac{3}{5}$ (only the positive root is considered).

The desired square can also be constructed without calculation. Take an arbitrary point $E$ on the circle and draw the tangent to the circle at point $E$.\n\nDraw a line through the center $O$ of the circle and the point $E$ (Fig. 2). Then draw a square whose axis of symmetry is the line $EO$ and whose two adjacent vertices lie on the tangent: let this be the square $ABCD$. Enlarge (or reduce) this square from the center $E$ so that the vertices $A$ and $B$ lie on the circle. The point $A'$ is the intersection of the line $EA$ and the circle, and the point $B'$ is the intersection of the line $EB$ and the circle. $A'B'$ will be the side of the desired square. From the similarity of the figures $ABCD$ and $A'B'C'D'$, it follows that $A'B'C'D'$ is also a square and satisfies the condition. The problem has only one solution (a line can intersect a circle in at most 2 points, one of which is $E$, the other is $A'$, or $B'$).\n\nWe still need to determine the length of the side of the square. Let $x$ be half the side of the square, for example, $A'F' = x$. Then $OF' = 2x - 1$, because $OE = 1$. $A'O = 1$, because it is a radius. In the triangle $A'F'O$, applying the Pythagorean theorem, we get $1 = x^2 + (2x - 1)^2$, which can be simplified to $5x^2 - 4x = 0$. From this, $x = \\frac{4}{5}$, which is half the side of the square, so the length of the side of the square is $\\frac{8}{5}$.\n\nBased on the solution by Csat\u00f3 Gy\u00f6rgy (Hajd\u00faszoboszl\u00f3, H\u0151gyes E.

Using the notation from Fig. 1, the construction part of the problem can also be solved by starting from the square and constructing a circle that passes through points $A$, $B$, and $E$ (basic construction). The completed diagram is then scaled so that the radius of the circle is one unit in length.

Choose points $P$ and $Q$ on the sides of the angle such that point $K$ is the midpoint of segment $P Q$. We will show that line $P Q$ cuts off a triangle of the smallest area. Take another line passing through point $K$. Let it intersect the sides of the angle at points $X$ and $Y$. By swapping $P$ with $Q$ and $X$ with $Y$ if necessary, we can assume that $X$ lies on segment $A P$. It is sufficient to prove that $K X < K Y$. Suppose $K X \\geqslant K Y$. Mark a point $Z$ on segment $K X$ such that $K Z = K Y$ (see the left figure). Triangles $K Q Y$ and $K P Z$ are equal by two sides and the angle, hence\n\n$$\n\\angle K Q Y = \\angle K P Z \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\angle Z P Q + \\angle A Q P = 180^{\\circ}.\n$$\n\nBut this is impossible, since point $Z$ lies inside triangle $A P Q$ and\n\n$$\n\\angle Z P Q + \\angle A Q P \\leqslant \\angle A P Q + \\angle A Q P = 150^{\\circ}.\n$$\n\n2.

Unfortunately, there are no terms in $x^{3}$ or $y^{2}$ in the expression $x+2 y+3 z$. Therefore, we need to split the term $x$ into three terms so that the application of the AM-GM inequality will introduce a term in $x^{3}$ which should simplify due to the assumption $x^{3} y^{2} z=1$.

Let's divide all the trees into groups of 12 standing in a row. There will be 6 complete groups and 3 more trees at the end. In each group, we will divide the trees into 6 pairs: the first with the seventh, the second with the eighth, ..., the sixth with the twelfth. Note that there are exactly 5 other trees between the trees in one pair, which means that there is at most one maple tree in this pair. Therefore, in each group of 12 consecutive trees, there are no more than 6 maple trees, so in total there are no more than $6 \\cdot 6+3=39$ maple trees.\n\nIt remains to show that 39 maple trees could have been planted. We will alternate groups of 6 maple trees with groups of 6 deciduous trees; at the end, we will plant a group of three maple trees. Then it is clear that there will be no more than 4 trees between two maple trees in one group, and no less than 6 trees between two maple trees in different groups."}

However, after consulting with his family, the tank battalion commander decided to make a surprise - initially, guests, as well as the commander himself, will make decisions about consuming buckwheat porridge, assuming that they will pay for it themselves, but at the end of the celebration, the commander will pay the total bill from his family's savings. He discovered that if the soldiers are lined up by height, there is a certain pattern in the changes in their demand functions. The demand for buckwheat porridge of the shortest soldier is given by \\( Q_d = 510 - 5.1P \\), the next tallest \\( Q_d = 520 - 5.2P \\), the next \\( Q_d = 530 - 5.3P \\), and so on.

In addition to the commander and the soldiers he invites, no one else demands porridge. Buckwheat porridge at the festival is offered by 25 perfectly competitive firms, each with a supply function \\( Q_s = 302P \\). The commander's family is willing to spend the entire amount allocated for the celebration, but if it is not enough, the commander will ask all guests to equally share the remaining bill.

Justify your answer.","role":"user"}],"response":"# Solution\n\n(a) The commander tries to feed as many soldiers as possible, which means he will primarily invite relatively short soldiers - all other things being equal, their porridge consumption is less.\n\nNote that the individual demand of soldiers is determined by the formula $Q_{d}=500+10 n-(5+0.1 n) P$, where $n$ is the ordinal number of the soldier. Also note that all consumers are willing to purchase the product at $P \\in [0; 100]$, which means that to find the market demand, it is sufficient to sum the individual demand functions.\n\nThe individual demand of the 45th soldier is $Q_{d}=950-9.5 P$. To find the demand of 45 soldiers, we can use the formula for the arithmetic progression:\n\n$Q_{d}=\\frac{(510-5.1 P + 500 + 10 n - (5 + 0.1 n) P)}{2} \\cdot n$\n\nIf $n=45$, then:\n\n$Q_{d}=32850-328.5 P$\n\nAdding the commander's demand, we get the market demand: $Q_{d}=33350-333.5 P$.\n\nAnswer: $Q_{d}=950-9.5 P, Q_{d}=33350-333.5 P$.\n\n(b) For the canteen, the profit maximization problem coincides with the revenue maximization problem, since marginal costs are zero.

For a linear demand function, $C S=\\frac{(P_{\\max }-P_{e}) Q}{2}$.

The proof must consider all cases, but the key idea is that if $A$ and $B$ are on a circle with center $O$, the triangle $A O B$ is isosceles. If the line $(A O)$ intersects the circle again at $A'$, since the sum of the three angles of the triangle $A O B$ is $180^{\\circ}$, $\\widehat{B O A'} = \\widehat{B A O} + \\widehat{A B O} = 2 \\cdot \\widehat{B A O}$, from which we deduce that the central angle $\\widehat{B O C}$, which does not depend on $A$, is twice the inscribed angle $\\widehat{B A C}$.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_10_8c44cd8b5c585c15e58bg-236.jpg?height=1002&width=994&top_left_y=361&top_left_x=354)\n\nIf we want a theorem that does not depend on the cases, we need to introduce angles of lines: the angle $(A B, A C)$ is the oriented angle through which the line $(A B)$ must be rotated to coincide with $(A C)$. Therefore, $(A B, A C) = -(A C, A B)$ and more generally: $(A B, A C) + (A C, A D) = (A B, A D)$ (Chasles' relation) for any points $A, B, C$, and $D$. Using these angles of lines, the inscribed angle theorem can be written: four points $A, B, C, D$ are on the same circle if and only if $(A B, A C) = (D B, D C)$.\n\nAn important special case of this theorem: the angle $\\widehat{B A C}$ is a right angle if and only if $A$ is located on the circle with diameter $[B C]$ (so the central angle is a straight angle)."}

Suppose $x>0$, we factorize: $3 \\cdot 2^{x}=(n-2)(n+2)$. The left-hand side is even, so the right-hand side is even. The two factors on the right-hand side are of the same parity, so they are both even, and we have two cases:\n\n- Case 1: $3 \\cdot 2^{\\mathrm{a}}=\\mathrm{n}-2$ and $2^{\\mathrm{b}}=\\mathrm{n}+2$, with $\\mathrm{a}+\\mathrm{b}=\\mathrm{x}$. We can combine these two equations to get $2^{b}=3 \\cdot 2^{a}+4$. Note that $n+2$ and $n-2$ have a difference of 4, so they cannot both be divisible by 8. Therefore, we have $a \\leqslant 2$ or $b \\leqslant 2$. Since $2^{b}>4$, we have $b>2$ and we deduce that $a \\leqslant 2$. If $a=0,2^{b}=3+4=7$ which is not possible. If $a=1,2^{b}=6+4=10$ which is not possible either. If $a=2$, then $2^{b}=12+4=16$ so $b=4$. We get $x=6$ and $\\mathrm{n}=14$. Conversely, we verify that $3 \\cdot 2^{6}+4=196=14^{2}$ and the pair $(6,14)$ is indeed a solution.\n- Case 2: $3 \\cdot 2^{\\mathrm{a}}=\\mathrm{n}+2$ and $2^{\\mathrm{b}}=\\mathrm{n}-2$, with $\\mathrm{a}+\\mathrm{b}=\\mathrm{x}$. The two equations combined give $\\overline{2^{\\mathrm{b}}+4}=3 \\cdot 2^{\\mathrm{a}}$. Similarly, we have $\\mathrm{a} \\leqslant 2$ or $\\mathrm{b} \\leqslant 2$.\n\n1. If $b \\leqslant 2$, then $b=0,1$ or 2. If $b=0$, then $5=3 \\cdot 2^{a}$ which is not possible. If $b=1$, $6=3 \\cdot 2^{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $\\mathrm{a}=1$, so $\\mathrm{x}=2$ and $\\mathrm{n}=4$ and we verify that $3 \\cdot 2^{2}+4=16=4^{2}$ and $(2,4)$ is indeed a solution. If $\\mathrm{b}=2$, then $8=3 \\cdot 2^{\\mathrm{a}}$ which is not possible.\n2. If $a \\leqslant 2$, then $a=0,1$ or 2. If $a=0,2^{b}+4=3<4$ which is not possible. If $a=1$, we fall back to the case where $b=1$ and the pair $(2,4)$. If $a=2,2^{b}+4=12$ so $b=3$. This gives $x=5$ and $\\mathrm{n}=10$. Conversely, we verify that $3 \\cdot 2^{5}+4=100=10^{2}$ and $(5,10)$ is indeed a solution.\n\nThus, the set of pairs $(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\mathfrak{n})$ that are solutions is $\\{(2,4),(5,10),(6,14)\\}$\n\nGraders' Comment: The exercise is generally well solved, but many students forget some cases, or simply forget to verify the solutions found, which is crucial in a Diophantine equation."}

Rimaniamo con 18 possibilit\u00e0 per le cifre finali. Ora dobbiamo scegliere altre tre cifre (non zero) di modo che la somma di tutte e cinque le cifre sia multipla di 3 , per garantire la divisibilit\u00e0 per 3. Utilizzando le congruenze modulo 3 , osserviamo che, per ogni possibile resto della divisione per 3 , vi sono esattamente 3 numeri tra 1 e 9 che lo danno (1, 4, 7 - 2, 5, 8 - 3, 6, 9). A meno dell'ordine, i vari resti modulo 3 si possono ottenere come somma di 3 resti in questi modi : $0 \\equiv 0+0+0 \\equiv 1+1+1 \\equiv 2+2+2 \\equiv 0+1+2$ $\\bmod 3,1 \\equiv 0+0+1 \\equiv 0+2+2 \\equiv 1+1+2 \\bmod 3,2 \\equiv 0+1+1 \\equiv 0+0+2 \\equiv 1+2+2$ mod 3.

Let the period be \\( T \\). Then:\n   \\[\n   y_{n+T} = y_n\n   \\]\n5. For \\( y_n \\) to be periodic, it must satisfy the recurrence relation:\n   \\[\n   y_{n+1} = \\frac{1 + y_n}{2}\n   \\]\n   This implies that \\( y_n \\) must reach a fixed point. Let \\( y_n = y \\) for all \\( n \\). Then:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{1 + y}{2}\n   \\]\n6. Solving for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   2y = 1 + y \\implies y = 1\n   \\]\n7. Therefore, \\( y_n = 1 \\) for all \\( n \\). This implies:\n   \\[\n   x_n x_{n+1} = 1 \\quad \\forall n\n   \\]\n8. Given \\( x_n x_{n+1} = 1 \\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{x_n}\n   \\]\n9. This implies that the sequence \\( \\{x_n\\} \\) alternates between \\( a \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) for some \\( a \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\). Therefore, the sequence is of the form:\n   \\[\n   a, \\frac{1}{a}, a, \\frac{1}{a}, \\ldots\n   \\]\n10.

The answer is (A). We observe that $N=10^{2024}+1$ and that a divisor of the required form can be written as $10^{n}+1$ for some $1<n<2024$. Assume then that $10^{n}+1$ divides $N$ and write\n\n$$\nN=10^{2024}+1=\\left(10^{n}+1\\right)\\left(10^{2024-n}\\right)+r_{1},\n$$\n\nfrom which $r_{1}=-\\left(10^{2024-n}-1\\right)$. Since $N$ is divisible by $10^{n}+1$, $r_{1}$ is also divisible by $10^{n}+1$. Repeating the same process, we get\n\n$$\n-r_{1}=10^{2024-n}-1=\\left(10^{n}+1\\right)\\left(10^{2024-2 n}\\right)+r_{2},\n$$\n\nfrom which $r_{2}=-\\left(10^{2024-2 n}+1\\right)$ is divisible by $10^{n}+1$ (essentially we are performing a kind of long division, in which we allow the remainder to be negative).\n\nIterating this reasoning, we obtain that $10^{2024-2 k n}+1$ is a multiple of $10^{n}+1$ for every $k$ for which $2024-2 k n$ is positive, and similarly $10^{2024-(2 k+1) n}-1$ must be a multiple of $10^{n}+1$ for every $k$ such that $2024-(2 k+1) n$ is positive. In particular, by choosing $k$ appropriately, we can make $2024-2 k n$ or $2024-(2 k+1) n$ positive and less than or equal to $n$ (essentially performing the division with remainder between 2024 and $n$): we then obtain that $10^{n}+1$ divides a number of the form $10^{a} \\pm 1$ with $1 \\leq a \\leq n$. If $a$ were strictly less than $n$, clearly $10^{a} \\pm 1$ would be less than $10^{n}+1$, and therefore could not be a multiple of it. Therefore, it must be that $a=n$ and that the sign is positive, which happens only if $n=2024-2 k n$, i.e., $2024=(2 k+1) n$. Thus, $n$ must be a proper divisor of 2024 with the property that 2024\/n is odd, i.e., $n=2^{3} d$, where $d$ is a proper divisor of $2024 \/ 2^{3}=253=11 \\cdot 23$. There are therefore 3 possibilities: $n=2^{3}, n=2^{3} \\cdot 11, n=2^{3} \\cdot 23$."}
