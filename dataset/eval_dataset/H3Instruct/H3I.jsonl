It's impossible because it goes against the first and second laws of thermodynamics.\r\n\r\nThe first law of thermodynamics is about energy. It says that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another. So if something is moving or working without any energy being added to it, where is the energy coming from?\r\n\r\nThe second law of thermodynamics is about heat. It says that heat always flows from hotter things to colder things, and that heat cannot flow from colder things to hotter things without some kind of work being done. So if you have a perpetual motion machine that is supposed to keep running forever, where is the heat going? The heat would build up and the machine would stop working.\r\n\r\nSo that's why perpetual motion is impossible. It would violate basic laws of physics!"}

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Transistors are tiny electronic components that are used to control the flow of electricity in circuits. They are made of a special type of material called semiconductor material, which can conduct electricity under some conditions and not conduct electricity under other conditions. Imagine a small switch that you can use to turn the flow of water on and off. That's kind of like what a transistor does with electricity. When you want the electricity to flow through a circuit, you turn the transistor on. When you don't want the electricity to flow, you turn the transistor off. Transistors are used in all kinds of electronic devices, including computers, phones, and TVs. They are very important because they allow us to control the flow of electricity in circuits, which is necessary for making all kinds of electronic devices work. Redstone is a material in the video game Minecraft that can be used to create simple circuits. Redstone circuits work a bit like transistor circuits, in that you can use them to control the flow of electricity (or in the case of Minecraft, redstone power) in a circuit. However, redstone circuits are much simpler than transistor circuits and are not used in real-world electronic devices."}
{"message":[{"content":"How to motivate young people to save money ","role":"user"}],"response":"In the United States you can't, because the average millennial in the United States has no opportunity to save money. Either you get a college education, then you will be burdened with a student loan. The cost of college education skyrocketed in the past decades. It is now practically impossible to enter the workforce without a huge debt, unless you are one of the lucky few who has rich and generous parents. Or you skip college. But college is the only way in the United States to obtain a generally accepted qualification, so you won't get any job which pays enough to save any money. As soon as that student loan is paid off, you need to get another loan for you house which you pay off for several decades. As soon as the house debt is paid off, you will be old and develop some medical problems. The medical bills will come in and you will be in debt again.

I'd be happy to help explain how the \"__ cousin, __ removed\" system works.\n\nIn this system, \"cousin\" refers to a relative who shares a common ancestor with you, but is not a direct ancestor or descendant. So for example, your parents' siblings' children (your first cousins) would be your first cousins.\n\nThe term \"removed\" refers to the number of generations between you and your cousin. So if you and your cousin are in the same generation (meaning you are the same age), you would be \"first cousins.\" If your cousin is one generation younger or older than you, you would be \"first cousins, once removed.\" If your cousin is two generations younger or older than you, you would be \"first cousins, twice removed,\" and so on.\n\nHere's an example to help illustrate this:\n\nImagine that you are the grandchild of two siblings (your grandparents). Your grandparents' siblings (your great-aunts and great-uncles) are your first cousins. If one of your first cousins has a child, that child would be your first cousin, once removed. If that child has a child, that child would be your first cousin, twice removed.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}

NFL Films uses a variety of techniques to create its programs, including slow motion, special camera angles, and dramatic music, in order to create a more exciting and immersive experience for viewers.\r\n\r\nOne reason that NFL Films programs can feel different from watching a game live is that they often include additional footage that was not shown during the live broadcast. For example, NFL Films might include footage from cameras that were positioned in different locations around the stadium, or they might show close-ups of players and coaches during key moments in the game. This can give viewers a different perspective on the game and provide them with more information about what was happening on the field.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that NFL Films programs can feel different is that they are often edited and produced in a way that emphasizes the drama and excitement of the game. This might involve using slow motion or other visual effects to highlight key plays, or adding dramatic music and sound effects to create a more intense atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOverall, NFL Films programs are designed to give viewers a more in-depth and immersive look at the sport of football, and to help them feel like they are right there on the field with the players and coaches."}
{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Linear classifier\"","role":"user"}],"response":"A linear classifier is a machine learning algorithm that is used to classify data points into one of two or more classes. It works by finding the linear decision boundary that separates the classes in the feature space. The decision boundary is a line or plane that separates the data points into different regions, with each region corresponding to a different class.\n\n\n\nLinear classifiers are based on the assumption that the data is linearly separable, meaning that there is a straight line or plane that can be drawn to separate the different classes. This means that the decision boundary is a linear function of the input features. Some examples of linear classifiers include logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines (SVMs).\n\n\n\nLinear classifiers are fast and easy to implement, and they work well on a wide range of problems. They are particularly useful when the data is high-dimensional and there are a large number of features, as they are able to handle this type of data efficiently. However, they may not be as effective on more complex datasets where the decision boundary is non-linear. In these cases, it may be necessary to use more powerful, non-linear classifiers such as neural networks."}
{"message":[{"content":"Why do the US only have two political parties represented in their legislature ? I 'm from NZ . I do n't get it .

This means that the political party that gets the most votes in an election wins all the seats in that election. This is different from many other countries, which have a proportional representation system, where each political party is awarded a number of seats based on the percentage of votes they receive. In a winner-takes-all system, it is difficult for a third party to win any seats because they are competing against the two main parties, which often have more resources and support. As a result, the two main parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, tend to dominate the political landscape in the United States. However, it is important to note that there are other political parties in the United States besides the Democrats and Republicans, and some of these parties do run candidates in elections. It is just that they tend to have less support and are not as successful at winning seats in the legislature."}

First and foremost, murder is a serious crime and is wrong because it involves taking the life of another human being. It is illegal in most countries and is punished severely. Additionally, such an action would likely result in widespread chaos and conflict, as it would disrupt the stability and order that is typically maintained by a functioning government. Furthermore, most modern royal families did not come to power through killing other royal families. While it is true that throughout history, there have been instances of royal families fighting for power and sometimes resorting to violence, this is not the norm in modern times. In many countries, the royal family serves a ceremonial or symbolic role, rather than a political one, and does not have the power to make decisions that directly affect the running of the government. Ultimately, the reasons for not killing a royal family to take over their position are the same as the reasons for not killing anyone else: it is morally wrong and goes against the values of most societies."}
{"message":[{"content":"Is the Net Profit the 'final word' on a company's health? ","role":"user"}],"response":"To answer your question briefly: net income is affected by many things inside and outside of management control, and must be supplemented by other elements to gain a clear picture of a company's health. To answer your question in-depth, we must look at the history of financial reporting: Initially, accounting was primarily cash-based. That is, a business records a sale when a customer pays them cash, and records expenses when cash goes out the door. This was not a perfectly accurate system, as cashflow might be quite erratic even if sales are stable (collection times may differ, etc.). To combat problems with cash-based accounting, financial reporting moved to an accrual-based system. An accrual is the recording of an item before it has fully completed in a cash transaction. For example, when you ship goods to a customer and they owe you money, you record the revenue - then you record the future collection of cash as a balance sheet item, rather than an income statement item. Another example: if your landlord charges you rent on December 31st for the past year, then in each month leading up to December, you accrue the expense on the income statement, even though you haven't paid the landlord yet. Accrual-based accounting leaves room for accounting manipulation. Enron is a prime example; among other things, they were accruing revenue for sales that had not occurred. This 'accelerated' their income, by having it recorded years before cash was ever collectible. There are specific guidelines that restrict doing things like this, but management will still attempt to accelerate net income as much as possible under accounting guidelines. Public companies have their financial statements audited by unrelated accounting firms - theoretically, they exist to catch material misstatements in the financial statements. Finally, some items impacting profit do not show up in net income - they show up in \"Other Comprehensive Income\" (OCI). OCI is meant to show items that occurred in the year, but were outside of management control. For example, changes in the value of foreign subsidiaries, due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Or changes in the value of company pension plan, which are impacted by the stock market. However, while OCI is meant to pick up all non-management-caused items, it is a grey area and may not be 100% representative of this idea. So in theory, net income is meant to represent items within management control. However, given the grey area in accounting interpretation, net income may be 'accelerated', and it also may include some items that occurred by some 'random business fluke' outside of company control. Finally, consider that financial statements are prepared months after the last year-end. So a company may show great profit for 2015 when statements come out in March, but perhaps Jan-March results are terrible. In conclusion, net income is an attempt at giving what you want: an accurate representation of the health of a company in terms of what is under management control. However it may be inaccurate due to various factors, from malfeasance to incompetence.  That's why other financial measures exist - as another way to answer the same question about a company's health, to see if those answers agree. ex: Say net income is $10M this year, but was only $6M last year - great, it went up by $4M! But now assume that Accounts Receivable shows $7M owed to the company at Dec 31, when last year there was only $1M owed to the company. That might imply that there are problems collecting on that additional revenue (perhaps revenue was recorded prematurely, or perhaps they sold to customers who went bankrupt).  Unfortunately there is no single number that you can use to see the whole company - different metrics must be used in conjunction to get a clear picture."}
{"message":[{"content":"Paying restaurants in cash instead of credit card - how signficant is this?","role":"user"}],"response":"Paying for meals at restaurants with cash instead of a credit card can have several potential benefits and drawbacks. Some of the potential benefits of paying in cash include:Avoiding credit card fees: Depending on the credit card you use, you may have to pay an annual fee or a fee for each transaction you make. By paying in cash, you can avoid these fees.Greater control over spending: When you pay with cash, you can only spend what you have on hand. This can help you better control your spending and avoid overspending.Improved budgeting: Paying with cash can also help you better track your expenses and budget for future purchases.However, there are also some potential drawbacks to paying in cash, including:Lack of protection: Credit cards offer various types of protection against fraud and unauthorized charges. When you pay with cash, you don't have this protection.Lack of rewards: Many credit cards offer rewards or points for every dollar you spend. If you regularly use a credit card that offers rewards, you may be missing out on these benefits by paying in cash.Limited acceptance: Some restaurants and other merchants may not accept cash payments, especially if they are trying to reduce contact due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Ultimately, whether it's better to pay in cash or with a credit card will depend on your individual financial situation and priorities. You may want to consider factors such as the fees you pay on your credit card, your ability to control your spending, and your desire to earn rewards."}

If a business owner earns an economic profit, it means that their revenue is greater than all of their costs, so they are making money. However, it's important to note that it's not always necessary for a business owner to earn an economic profit in order to make money. For example, if a business owner's revenue is enough to cover all of their costs, they are said to be earning a \"normal\" or \"zero\" economic profit. While they may not be earning an economic profit, they are still able to pay themselves a salary and make a living from running the business. In some cases, a business owner may even choose to operate their business at a loss (i.e. with negative economic profit) in the short term in order to invest in the business and position it for future growth. For example, a business owner may choose to invest in marketing and advertising in order to attract more customers, even if this means operating at a loss in the short term. In the long term, this investment could lead to increased revenue and profits for the business. Overall, it's important for a business owner to carefully consider all of the costs of running their business and make strategic decisions about how to balance their short-term and long-term goals."}

For example, a magnet made of iron will have a stronger magnetic field than a magnet made of copper, because the electrons in iron are more strongly attracted to the nucleus of the atom.So to summarize, the energy that creates the magnetic force comes from the movement of the electrons in the material. This movement is caused by different factors, such as the type of material and its temperature."}
{"message":[{"content":"The plot of Donnie Darko I enjoyed this movie , but I never felt like I totally understood the plot . What exactly is going on here ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Sure, I can try to explain the plot of \"Donnie Darko\" to you in a way that is easy to understand. The movie is about a teenager named Donnie who starts seeing strange things and having strange experiences. One night, he is visited by a figure in a rabbit costume who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days.

As the days pass, Donnie starts to uncover a mystery involving time travel, alternate realities, and a group of people who are trying to change the course of history. Along the way, he meets a girl named Gretchen, who helps him try to figure out what is happening. At the end of the movie, it is revealed that Donnie has been traveling through time, and that he has the power to change the past and alter the future. He ultimately decides to go back in time and prevent the disaster that Frank had warned him about, sacrificing his own life in the process. So, in short, \"Donnie Darko\" is a movie about a teenager who is given the power to change the world, and the choices he makes as he tries to prevent a disaster from occurring."}

It's possible that the ad you're referring to is being displayed on a website, and the website is using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to control how the content is displayed in the web browser. \nTo print something that large, you would need a special type of printer called a wide-format printer. These printers are designed to print on very large sheets of paper or other materials, such as vinyl or canvas. They are often used to print banners, posters, trade show graphics, wallpaper, murals, and other large-scale graphics. \nThere are several different technologies that wide-format printers use to print, including inkjet, thermal, and laser. Inkjet printers use jets of ink to apply the image to the printing material, while thermal printers use heat to transfer the image onto the material. Laser printers use a laser beam to transfer the image onto the material. \nWide-format printers are often used for advertising and marketing purposes, as well as for printing graphics for events, exhibitions, and other large-scale projects.

There is something called the * flicker fusion threshold * which is basically the period at which a flashing light appears as a solid light rather than a flashing one . It turns out that the flicker fusion threshold is not constant across your visual field .

However , at the edges of your vision , it has to be as high as 90 - 120 hz before a flashing light will appear as a solid light .

It can come from different parts of the pig's body, such as the shoulder, loin, or leg, and can be used to make a variety of dishes, such as pork chops, roast pork, or pulled pork.Ham is made from the hind leg of a pig. It is cured, which means it is soaked in a mixture of salt, sugar, and other flavorings before being cooked. Ham is often served as a main dish at holiday meals or as a sandwich filling.Bacon is made from the belly of a pig. It is also cured, but it is typically smoked after the curing process to give it its distinctive flavor. Bacon is often eaten as a breakfast food or used as a topping for dishes like burgers or salads.So, in summary, pork is the general term for meat from a pig, ham is made from the hind leg of a pig and is cured, and bacon is made from the belly of a pig, is cured, and is smoked."}

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Flossing is good for your heart because it helps to remove plaque from between your teeth and along the gumline. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on your teeth and gums. If you don't remove it, it can harden and turn into tartar, which can cause gum disease. Gum disease is an infection of the gums that can cause them to become swollen, red, and painful. It can also cause your gums to pull away from your teeth, which can lead to tooth loss.\r\n\r\nGum disease has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. This is because the bacteria that cause gum disease can enter your bloodstream through the gums and travel to your heart. When this happens, it can cause inflammation in your heart, which can lead to heart problems. Flossing helps to remove the bacteria that cause gum disease, which can help to reduce your risk of developing heart disease.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, flossing is good for your heart because it helps to keep your gums healthy and prevent gum disease, which can lead to heart problems."}

This means that the same video game will work on every computer without having to be rewritten for every single machine it 's expected to run on - It is actually composed of a couple of components : Direct3D , DirectShow , DirectSound , DirectInput , and a few more I 'm probably missing . - By far , the most important of these ( and the one MS has sunk the most time and money into ) is Direct3D. - As you may know , everything you see in a 3D video game is made of a bunch of polygons . Even if you see a sphere , it 's actually made of a bunch of tiny triangles that are so small that they give the illusion of a smooth curve . - Here is an example of Leon from Resident Evil 4 to help you visualize this fact : URL_0 - Direct3D allows video games to say to the 3D graphics hardware , \" Hey man , here are a bunch of triangles and here are instructions on where to put them , what color they should be , what textures they should have , how to light them up , etc \" - DirectSound allows video games to say to the sound card , \" Hey dude , here is a sound wave I want to you play through the speakers at this volume , with this speed , and I want you to mix it with several other sounds \" - A version of DirectX has shipped with Windows ever since Windows 95 , but they were horrible . - Windows XP shipped with DirectX 9 , which was considered to be the first version of DX that did n't totally suck . - Ever since then , DirectX 10 came with Vista and DirectX 11 with Windows 7 . - Video games are generally tested with very specific subversions of DirectX , Ex .

{"message":[{"content":"Why is it good to borrow money to buy a house?","role":"user"}],"response":"There are several reasons why borrowing money to buy a house can be a good financial decision:Leverage: Borrowing money to purchase a home allows you to buy a property that you might not be able to afford if you had to pay the full price upfront. This is known as leverage, and it can potentially increase your return on investment if the value of the property appreciates over time.Potential tax benefits: In some countries, you may be able to claim a tax deduction on the interest you pay on your mortgage. This can reduce the overall cost of borrowing and make homeownership more affordable.Forced savings: Making mortgage payments can help you build equity in your home, which is the difference between the value of your home and the amount you owe on your mortgage. As you pay off your mortgage, you build equity in your home, which can be a source of financial security in the future.Stable monthly payments: With a fixed-rate mortgage, your monthly payments are the same throughout the term of the loan. This can help you budget and plan for the future, as you'll know exactly what your housing costs will be each month.Overall, borrowing money to buy a house can be a good financial decision if you can afford the monthly mortgage payments and if you believe that the value of the property will appreciate over time. It's important to carefully consider your financial situation and do your research before taking on a mortgage."}

When data is sent over the internet or other networks, it is divided into small packets and each packet is sent to its destination through a specific port. \nSometimes, a device or computer on a network might have certain services or applications that need to receive data from the internet. For example, a computer might have a web server running on it that needs to receive data from the internet so that other people can access the website hosted on that computer. In this case, the computer would need to have a specific port open to receive data from the internet. \n\"Port forwarding\" is a process that allows a device or computer to receive data from the internet through a specific port. When you \"forward a port,\" you are telling your router or network device to send data that comes in through a specific port to a specific device on your network. \nFor example, let's say you have a computer on your network that is running a web server. You might want to forward port 80 (the default port for HTTP traffic) to that computer so that people can access the website hosted on that computer from the internet. In this case, you would set up port forwarding on your router so that any data that comes in through port 80 is sent to the computer running the web server. \nIn summary, port forwarding allows you to receive data from the internet on a specific port on your device or computer, which can be useful if you are running certain services or applications that need to receive data from the internet."}

{"message":[{"content":"Is the Chrysler extended warranty coverage worth it?","role":"user"}],"response":"I haven't looked at that warranty in detail, but generally speaking this should help. What is GAP insurance? In the case of a total loss\/write off gap insurance covers the outstanding finance after your regular insurance pay out. The two won't match up usually because of the depreciation right after you buy the car. For example, if you take out $20,000 finance and buy a car, then write it off after six months, your insurance company may only value it at $16,000 but it's unlikely you will have cleared $4,000 from your finance. Gap insurance will pay out the difference and settle the debt. Will Chrysler change the engine, if it comes to bhore? Yes, unless they identify misuse or deliberate damage. For instance, if you do 1000 miles and the engine explodes, it's a mechanical fault that the warranty would cover. If they open up the engine\/look at diagnostics and find it's been thrashed to within an inch of it's life, they may claim it was your driving which has destroyed the engine and you would have to prove it was an underlying fault and would have blown either way. Will car dents be covered with this bumper to bumper insurance? Not likely, as I mentioned in the last point, if it's your fault it wouldn't be covered. I think you may be confusing the terms insurance and warranty at this point. Insurance would cover your dents but a warranty only covers the manufacturer's faults, even in the case of extended warranties. What does basic mean in terms of warranty? Sounds obvious, but whatever Chrysler want it to mean!

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"There are a few reasons why helicopters were not used to rescue people from the World Trade Center during the September 11th attacks.\n\nFirst, the World Trade Center towers were very tall buildings, and it would have been difficult for a helicopter to hover at such a high altitude for an extended period of time. Additionally, the winds around the towers were very strong, which would have made it even more challenging for a helicopter to remain stable.\n\nSecond, the fires and smoke in the towers were very intense, and it would have been dangerous for anyone, including the pilots, to fly a helicopter into those conditions.\n\nFinally, the planes that crashed into the towers caused a lot of damage, and it is likely that the helicopters would not have been able to land safely on the roofs of the towers.\n\nOverall, while it might seem like a good idea to use helicopters to rescue people from the World Trade Center, it was not a practical solution due to the unique challenges and dangers presented by the situation."}

{"message":[{"content":"Is poop chronological ? Is the first thing I eat always the first thing to come out ? Or does my breakfast sometimes get passed by my lunch ? Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Poop is not exactly chronological, but the process of digestion does generally follow a certain order. When you eat something, your body breaks down the food using enzymes and other substances in your digestive system. The process of digestion starts in your mouth, where your teeth and saliva help to break down the food. The food then moves through your esophagus and into your stomach, where it is mixed with stomach acid to help break it down further. After the food has been broken down in the stomach, it moves into the small intestine. The small intestine is where most of the nutrients from the food are absorbed into the body. The remaining waste material moves into the large intestine, where water and electrolytes are absorbed. Finally, the waste material is eliminated from the body through the rectum and anus as poop. So, while the process of digestion does not happen in a strictly chronological order, the food you eat will generally be digested and eliminated in the order that you eat it. That means that if you eat breakfast first, the waste material from your breakfast will likely be eliminated first. However, it is possible that the waste material from your lunch or dinner could be eliminated before the waste material from your breakfast, depending on how long it takes your body to digest and eliminate the food."}

This is often done through a process called immunoassay, which uses antibodies to specifically bind to the substance being tested for.\\n\\nTreatment: Antibodies can be used to treat certain diseases, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders. For example, monoclonal antibodies are man-made versions of natural antibodies that can be used to target and neutralize specific substances in the body, such as cancer cells.\\n\\nResearch: Antibodies can be used in research to study the functions of specific proteins or other substances in the body. For example, researchers may use antibodies to study the role of a particular protein in a particular disease or process.\\n\\nVaccines: Antibodies can be used in the development of vaccines, which help to stimulate the immune system to produce its own antibodies against a particular disease. This can help to protect against future infection with the disease.\\n\\nOverall, antibodies play a crucial role in the immune system's ability to protect the body against infection and disease."}

This is how some of our presidents got elected without needing an actual majority vote from the general populace . this may have some bias in it but that 's up for debate * as well * pun not originally intended I 'm guessing you may also want an explanation of electoral college ? ? short version : this results in single votes in one state be worth more than single votes in another state . which inequalizes the power of 1person=1vote to 1person=2 - 3votes in comparison between states . and one last thing : us americans do n't really have the right to vote at all , it was never a written right for us and the founders of america designed it to originally only allow the government itself to elect its own leadership . My best guess beyond this point is that they did this because they did not want presidential candidates trying to influence public opinion to pressure the government into giving him presidency fearing severely misinformed public disapproval . why prevent them from influencing public to such degree ? because they knew even back then that public masses can be easy to influence ."}

{"message":[{"content":"Are multiple hard inquiries for a specific loan type okay?","role":"user"}],"response":"tl;dr: Your best course of action is probably to do a soft pull (check your own credit) and provide that to the lender for an unofficial pre-approval to get the ball rolling. The long of it: The loan officer is mostly correct, and I have recent personal evidence that corroborates that. A few months ago I looked into refinancing a mortgage on a rental property, and I allowed 3 different lenders to do a hard inquiry within 1 week of each other. I saw all 3 inquires appear on reports from each of the 3 credit bureaus (EQ\/TU\/EX), but it was only counted as a single inquiry in my score factors. But as you have suggested, this breaks down when you know that you won't be purchasing right away, because then you will have multiple hard inquiries at least a few months apart which could possibly have a (minor) negative impact on your score. However minor it is, you might as well try to avoid it if you can. I have played around with the simulator on myfico.com, and have found inquiries to have the following effect on your credit score using the FICO Score 8 model: With one inquiry, your scores will adjust as such: Two inquiries: Three inquiries: Here's a helpful quote from the simulator notes: \"Credit inquiries remain on your credit report for 2 years, but FICO Scores only consider credit inquiries from the past 12 months.\" Of course, take that with a grain of salt, as myfico provides the following disclaimer: The Simulator is provided for informational purposes only and should not be expected to provide accurate predictions in all situations. Consequently, we make no promise or guarantee with regard to the Simulator. Having said all that, in your situation, if you know with certainty that you will not be purchasing right away, then I would recommend doing a soft pull to get your scores now (check your credit yourself), and see if the lender will use those numbers to estimate your pre-approval. One possible downside of this is the lender may not be able to give you an official pre-approval letter based on your soft pull. I wouldn't worry too much about that though since if you are suddenly ready to purchase you could just tell them to go ahead with the hard pull so they can furnish an official pre-approval letter. Interesting Side Note: Last month I applied for a new mortgage and my score was about 40 points lower than it was 3 months ago. At first I thought this was due to my recent refinancing of property and the credit inquiries that came along with it, but then I noticed that one of my business credit cards had recently accrued a high balance. It just so happens that this particular business CC reports to my personal credit report (most likely in error but I never bothered to do anything about it). I immediately paid that CC off in full, and checked my credit 20 days later after it had reported, and my score shot back up by over 30 points. I called my lender and instructed them to re-pull my credit (hard inquiry), which they did, and this pushed me back up into the best mortgage rate category. Yes, I purposely requested another hard pull, but it shouldn't affect my score since it was within 45 days, and that maneuver will save me thousands in the long run."}

It is located on a military base in Cuba, and it was used to hold people who were suspected of being involved in terrorism. President Obama did order the detention center to be shut down when he came into office, but it has not yet been closed. There are a few reasons why it has taken so long to close the detention center. One reason is that it is difficult to find places to transfer the detainees who are being held there. Some of the detainees cannot be sent back to their home countries because they might be in danger, and it is not easy to find other countries that are willing to take them in. Additionally, closing the detention center requires a lot of planning and coordination between different government agencies, and this can take time.

It is a problem that exists in many countries, not just the United States. In order to address this issue, some countries have put in place independent or nonpartisan bodies to handle the process of drawing electoral district boundaries. These bodies are designed to be free from political influence and to create district boundaries that are fair and representative of the population.\\n\\nIn Canada, for example, the process of redistricting (redrawing electoral district boundaries) is handled by an independent body called the Electoral Boundaries Commission. This commission is made up of judges, academics, and other experts who are appointed by the federal government. The commission is responsible for reviewing the boundaries of electoral districts and making recommendations for changes based on factors such as population changes and community interests.\\n\\nIn Europe, many countries also have independent or nonpartisan bodies that are responsible for drawing electoral district boundaries. In some cases, these bodies are required to follow specific rules or guidelines in order to ensure that the process is fair and free from political influence. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Boundary Commission is required to follow certain rules when redrawing electoral district boundaries, including the need to ensure that the number of voters in each district is as equal as possible.\\n\\nTo explain it like you're five: In some countries, there are special groups of people who make sure that the lines on maps that show where people live and vote are fair and not biased towards any one group.

{"message":[{"content":"Good Percentage Return on Equity? ","role":"user"}],"response":"It is difficult to determine a specific percentage that would be considered a \"good\" return on equity (ROE) since it can vary depending on a variety of factors such as the industry in which a company operates, the level of risk involved in the business, and the company's financial and operational performance.However, a high ROE is generally considered to be a good sign that a company is managing its assets effectively and generating a strong profit. A ROE of 15% or higher is often considered to be a good benchmark, although this can vary depending on the industry and other factors.It's important to note that a high ROE is not the only factor to consider when evaluating a company. Other financial metrics such as earnings per share, return on assets, and debt-to-equity ratio should also be taken into account when evaluating a company's financial performance and potential for investment."}
{"message":[{"content":"Evolution Please explain to me Evolution , the way I have been brought up I have never learned about it . Thanks . Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Sure! Evolution is the process by which living things change over time. It's kind of like how you grow and change as you get older. But instead of just changing over a few years, evolution happens over many, many years.\r\n\r\nAll living things have traits, or characteristics, that they can pass down to their babies. For example, some people have brown eyes and some people have blue eyes. If a mom and a dad with brown eyes have a baby, the baby might have brown eyes too. That's because the baby gets some traits from the mom and some traits from the dad.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though, a baby might get a trait that it didn't get from its mom or dad. Maybe the baby will have a new trait that no one in its family has ever had before. This can happen because of something called a mutation, which is a change in the genes that control how a living thing looks and acts. Mutations can be small, like a change in the color of a flower, or big, like a change in the shape of a beak.\r\n\r\nOver time, living things with traits that help them survive and have babies will have more babies than living things with traits that don't help them survive. This is because the living things with helpful traits are more likely to survive and pass their traits down to their babies.\r\n\r\nSo, over many, many years, the traits of a group of living things can change. This is called evolution. Evolution helps living things adapt to their environment and helps them survive. It's a very slow process, but it's an important part of how living things change and grow over time."}

This can be a negative trait because it can lead to unrealistic expectations and an inability to accept mistakes or imperfections. It can also lead to excessive stress, anxiety, and disappointment. \nDoing your best, on the other hand, means trying your hardest and striving for excellence, but also accepting that mistakes and imperfections are a natural part of the process. It means being proud of what you have achieved, even if it is not perfect. \nImagine you are trying to draw a picture. If you are a perfectionist, you might get frustrated if the lines are not perfectly straight, or if the colors are not exactly as you imagined them. You might even give up on the drawing altogether because it is not perfect. If you are just trying your best, you might still strive to make your drawing as good as possible, but you will also be proud of what you have created, even if it is not perfect. \nSo in short, perfectionism is the belief that everything must be perfect, while doing your best means trying your hardest and being proud of your efforts, even if they are not perfect."}

{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Real numbers\"","role":"user"}],"response":"In mathematics, a real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as a distance, duration or temperature. Here, continuous means that values can have arbitrarily small variations.[a] Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite decimal expansion.[b]\nThe real numbers are fundamental in calculus (and more generally in all mathematics), in particular by their role in the classical definitions of limits, continuity and derivatives.[c]\nThe set of real numbers is denoted R or \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n\n and is sometimes called \"the reals\".\nThe adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by Ren\u00e9 Descartes to distinguish real numbers, associated with physical reality, from imaginary numbers (such as the square roots of \u22121), which seemed like a theoretical contrivance unrelated to physical reality.\nThe real numbers include the rational numbers, such as the integer \u22125 and the fraction 4\u200a\/\u200a3. The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers, and include algebraic numbers (such as the square root \u221a2 = 1.414...) and transcendental numbers (such as \u03c0 = 3.1415...).\nReal numbers can be thought of as all points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.\nConversely, analytic geometry is the association of points on lines (especially axis lines) to real numbers such that geometric displacements are proportional to differences between corresponding numbers.\nThe informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field.[d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent."}

I hear things like \" you were legally dead for 10 minutes \" and such on TV , and I 'm aware it is used in real life as well , but what really happens ? Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"It's important to understand that once someone is pronounced dead, it is very difficult for them to come back to life. In some cases, people may appear to be dead but are actually in a state of unconsciousness or have a very slow heartbeat, and medical professionals may be able to revive them using certain techniques. This is more commonly known as \"cardiac arrest\" rather than being \"dead,\" however.Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating suddenly. When this happens, the body is no longer getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs, and the person will lose consciousness and stop breathing. If someone experiences cardiac arrest and receives medical treatment within a few minutes, it may be possible to revive them using techniques such as CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) or defibrillation, which involves using an electric shock to try to restart the heart.However, once someone has been pronounced dead, it is generally not possible to bring them back to life. Death is a final and irreversible process, and once it has occurred, it is not possible to reverse it.

{"message":[{"content":"Ghana scam and direct deposit scam?","role":"user"}],"response":"!Ghana scams and direct deposit scams are types of financial fraud that target individuals and businesses.Ghana scams, also known as \"419 scams,\" are named after the section of the Nigerian criminal code that deals with fraud. These scams often involve someone pretending to be from Ghana or another West African country, contacting individuals or businesses by email or social media and offering a large sum of money in exchange for help in transferring the funds out of the country. The scammer may ask the victim to provide personal or financial information, or to send money to cover fees or expenses associated with the supposed transfer of funds. However, the money and the individual or business offering it are both fake, and the victim ends up losing their money or personal information to the scammer.A direct deposit scam is a type of scam in which an individual or group of individuals pretend to be a legitimate employer or government agency and request that an employee or individual's direct deposit be changed to a different account. The scammer may ask the victim to provide personal or financial information, or to login to their online banking or payroll account to make the change. Once the victim has provided the necessary information or made the change, the scammer is able to access their direct deposit and steal their money.It is important to be cautious when dealing with unsolicited requests for personal or financial information, or offers of large sums of money, especially if they come from unfamiliar individuals or businesses. If you suspect that you have been targeted by a Ghana scam or a direct deposit scam, it is important to report the incident to the authorities and to take steps to protect your personal and financial information.This content may violate our content policy.

{"message":[{"content":"Why are Scandinavians so incredibly good at speaking English ? I 've seen plenty of interviews and videos of people from Norway or Sweden speaking in their language but they sing and talk perfectly in English . Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"* * Edit :* * All right , guys . This was an oversimplified answer to begin with and I was never expecting to get this many upvotes . It should be noted that there are * * a lot * * of things at play , when talking about how easy a language is to learn , for someone else . This was never meant to be the top answer , but now that is it , I 've asked someone , who 's obviously a lot more knowledgeable on the subject than myself , to comment on the matter . If and when they do , I will be back to update this , so that we can spread actual knowledge , rather than oversimplifications of otherwise complicated things . * * Edit 2 :* * * * \/u \/ eurodditor was kind enough to reply to my request and has given a far better explanation , than I ever could . Enjoy ! * * * \" There are tons of stuff that work the same in english and scandinavian languages . I gave you the example of the way to form superlatives and comparatives ( -er and -est or something similar ) which only work for germanic languages , there 's many many examples like these . Here are a few that come to mind :* * * The similarity of irregular ( aka strong ) verbs . The list is about the same and some even work the same way ( at least in swedish , compare drink drank drunk to drick drack druckit ) . * * * The way to forme genitive ( adding an -s ) * * * The very many similarities in the way you use suffixes ( laktosfri \/ lactose - free , hope - > hopeless , hopeful \/ h\u00e5b - > h\u00e5bl\u00f8s , h\u00e5befuld ... ) , also think how almost every adjective you transformed into a noun using -ness ( harshness , highness , frankness , loneliness ... ) can be transformed exactly the same way in danish using -hed ( h\u00e5rdhed , h\u00f8jhed , oprigtighed , ensomhed ... ) . * * * There are also many similarities with common idiomas : Think how \" how old are you ? \" works the same way in danish with \" hvor gammel er du ? \" ( not sure of the spelling ) . In french for example , we instead ask something that roughly translates as \" which age do you have ? \" - this is only one example but there 's plenty of them . * * * Even the way we use genders to refer to things . This is kinda hard to explain but an example will help . In swedish ( I think it works the same in danish but I do n't have the exact words ) , if you talk about a woman 's son you will say \" hon \u00e4r gammal men hennes son \u00e4r ung \" , notice how \" hennes \" is female because we 're talking about the son of a female . It works the same in english \" she is old but her son is young \" . But for example it does n't work like that in french . Instead , we would say \" she is old but his son is young \" because the pronoun is linked to the son , not to the mom . * * I could go on forever . Germanic languages have a lot in common , much more than a germanic language and a latin language . And besides , continental scandinavian languages have evolved much the same way as english regarding the simplification of the language ( no more declensions - unlike in german or icelandic , almost no more conjugations , etc . ) * * There are of course differences , and they can be hard to grasp at first for someone who is n't very good at learning languages . An example would be the postpositive article in scandinavian languages ( huset instead of det hus ) , or the way you form plural which changes from word to word ( huse , husene , boller , bollerne ... it 's even worse in swedish because sometimes it ends in -ar , sometimes in -or , sometimes in -er , sometimes with nothing ) . \" * Please keep in mind , that not only Scandinavia , but all ( or at the very least most ) of the Nordics , including the self - governing islands , speak English really well . This is to say , that even though what \/u \/ eurodditor says is definitely correct , the exposure we get to the English language , is just as important , as the fact that our languages are similar . - All in all , Scandinavians just have it easy , but studying and exposure is a huge factor as well , when it comes to actually learning the language . * \" Hard work beats talent , if talent does n't work hard . \" * * * Original answer :* * Most of us are taught English from the third grade and some start even earlier than that . ( In Denmark ) That , combined with the fact that our own languages also use the Latin alphabet , is what helps us become so good at it . - It 's as simple as that ! * * As \/u \/ sitroniste pointed out :* * I completely forgot to mention that we 're very small countries , which means that our entertainment and learning materials have rarely been translated into our own languages , as well as us bordering to countries that do n't speak the same languages as we do . All in all , we 're forced to use English a lot of the time ."}

The Sympathetic nervous system and the Parasympathetic nervous system . These are what control our internals , stuff like homoeostasis and digestion . Basic functions of life that every animal has to do and not think about . Your parasympathetic nervous system handles stuff like digestion , arousal , bladder control stuff like that . Your sympathetic nervous system handles stuff like kick starting your heart so you can run away from that angry bear . These two nervous systems work in opposition to each other . For example , you 'd never lose bladder control randomly while watching TV ( unless you were watching The Shining ) . For people with anxiety problems the sympathetic nervous system gets activated at anything the person finds scary \/ threatening . Our brains are dumb and really smart at the same time . For all our brain knows , we are scared of public speaking because we might die from it . So it 'll tell the sympathetic nervous system to turn on until the threat is dealt with . That is what causes symptoms of fast heart rates , sweating and the feeling of wanting to get out of wherever you are . Your brain literally thinks what your doing is life threatening . As for what causes it , we do n't really know . The brain is very understudied \/ very new field of research so we 're are finding about a lot of new things quickly .

It is often associated with criminal activity, such as drug trafficking or arms smuggling, but it can also include legal goods that are sold illegally, such as protected wildlife or stolen items.\r\n\r\nThe black market is not a physical place, like a store or a club. It is more like a network of people who are involved in illegal or illicit activities. These people may communicate with each other through secret means, such as encrypted messages or word of mouth, to arrange transactions.\r\n\r\nThe government tries to crack down on the black market and arrest the people involved in illegal activities, but it can be difficult to find and dismantle these networks. The black market operates in the shadows, making it hard to track and monitor. It is also constantly changing, with new people and groups coming and going all the time.\r\n\r\nDespite the efforts of law enforcement, the black market continues to exist and is a significant part of many illegal industries.

I now have $ 1 from selling worthless items which I obtained by accident while enjoying myself . How is this possible ? Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Steam trading cards are virtual cards that you can get by playing certain games on the Steam platform. Some people like to collect these cards because they are a way to show off their favorite games or because they enjoy the process of collecting them. Some people also like to trade these cards with other players to try and get cards that they don't already have. As for why people would pay money for these virtual cards, it's because some people value the cards as a way to show off their favorite games or as a way to collect something. Just like how some people collect physical trading cards, stamps, or other collectibles, some people enjoy collecting virtual items as well. In the same way that some people might be willing to pay money for a rare physical trading card, some people might be willing to pay money for a rare virtual trading card. It's also possible that some people might be willing to pay money for these virtual cards because they can be used to craft badges on Steam, which can then be displayed on a player's profile. These badges can show off a player's accomplishments or interests, and some people might see them as a way to show off their love for a particular game or as a way to connect with other players who have similar interests. Finally, it's important to remember that not all Steam trading cards are worth the same amount of money. Some cards are more common and might not be worth very much, while others are rarer and might be worth more. Just like with any collectible, the value of a Steam trading card can vary based on a variety of factors."}
{"message":[{"content":"What does net selling or buying of a stock mean?","role":"user"}],"response":"I'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning. We can think of \"what does this mean\" in two ways: its broad semantic\/metaphorical meaning, and its mechanical \"what actual variables in the market represent this quantity\". Net buying\/selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets. It's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense. Roughly, as the top comment notes, you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level, while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level. But in terms of actual market mechanics, the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller, so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid\/ask spread. So then we could think about the notion of orders. Actual transactions only occur in balance, but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices. So maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid\/ask books to decide some notion of net buying\/selling. But again, actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread. If a significant order volume is added on one side or the other, but at a price far away from the bid\/offer - far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur - should that be included in the notion of net buying\/selling? Presumably there is some price distance from the bid\/offer where the orders don't matter for net buying\/selling. I'm sure you'd find a lot of buyers for BRK.A at $1, but that's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying\/selling in BRK.A. Maybe the closest thing I can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price. Assuming that traders' valuations are fixed through the period in question, and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals (which I know isn't a good assumption in practice, but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis), we have two cases. If price falls, we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price (saving money), while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more. The former will be larger than the latter. If the price rises, the reverse is true."}

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"( As a note , it seems I 've spent most of my post explaining magnets and how the earths magnetic core works , instead of explaining the process of identifying historical pole reversals from seacores . But I 'll be damned if I wrote this all up , only to throw it away . ) * * Edit :* * As this post seemed to gain some popularity , I would like to clarify that I am not a physicist , nor a geologist , and most \/ all of the information was done with a little internet research . A few comments have pointed out a few \" nitpicky \" errors , and I 've tried my best to amend them . But it 's nitpicky details that makes patterns recognizable , and learning fun . Wow , Mr. 5 - year - old , sudden magnetic pole reversals ? Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . First of all , what in the hell IS magnetism ? It 's all electrons . ( * * Edit :* * Kind of . Keep reading . ) Electrons are tiiiiiiiny tiny things that exist everywhere and within everything . I could go on about how crazy electrons are , but that would be a totally different explanation . When an electron moves from point A to point B , it produces a magnetic field . That field has a shape and strength that is specific to how the electron moved . Wait , what ? Where was the magnet that produced the magnetic field ? There was none . It was the electron . In fact , when an object creates a stable magnetic field , all that is really happeneing is a bunch of electrons inside the object are moving in a structured , stable fashion . When a lot of electrons are all moving in the same way , it creates a stonger magnetic field . Woooow , that 's crazy . Magnetic fields are kind of like the byproduct of a moving electron . Fact 1 : The movement of electrons cause magnetic fields . ( * * Edit :* * A magnetic field is created for any timely change in the electric field . It does n't matter if this is caused by electrons moving , or protons , or carbon core nuclei , or even just because there 's a electromagnetic wave coming by , without any massive particle being associated . Thank you datenwolf ! However , a moving electron is relevant to this application , and is what will be continued to be used as an example throughout the post . But just be aware that electrons do n't have a monopoly on the magnetic field front . ) But that 's not all ! Let 's take that magnetic field that was produced by the first electron , and place it next to an electron that is n't moving . That electron will move in the same way the the first electron did . So , not only will a moving electron will create a magnetic field , but a magnetic field will move an electron . You can think about this as one of those \" For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction \" sort of deals . Fact 2 : Magnetic fields cause movement in electrons . ( * * Edit :* * Just as electron movement is n't the sole creator of magnetic fields , magnetic fields can cause more things to happen than electron movement . Once again , it 's relevant to the discussed application , so we 're sticking with it , but just keep in mind that magnetic fields are more than electron movers . Once again , thank you datenwolf for pointing me in the right direction . ) So what 's with my fridge magnet ? Does it have a bunch of electrons raging through it ? Unfortunately , no . Some materials , like iron , copper , and your fridge magnet , exhibit a high level of a property called \" magnetism \" , and are called \" magnets \" . Like most common objects , their electrons do n't move enough on their to create magnetic fields . However , when placed in a magnetic field , their electrons ebb and flow with the force . They 'll try to line up with the force of the field , and in some cases , move along with the field . Pretty crazy . Materials that are n't very magnetic , like plastic and cloth , do not move along with the magnetic fields . That 's why your fridge magnet does n't stick to your shirt or your shoes ! Fact 3 : Materials that are magnetic are affected by magnetic fields . Have you ever wrapped a live wire around an iron core to create a magnet ? Electricity is all just moving electrons . So , when you wrap the wire around a lot of times , the electrons are moving in the same , structured way a lot of times , creating your magnetic field . The more wraps of wire , and the faster that the electrons move , the stronger of a magnetic field it creates . This wo n't happen if you wrap a wire around a pencil ; the core must be magnetic . This is a property called \" electromagnetecism \" , which is a property that all magnets exhibit . Fact 4 : Electrons circling around a magnet create a magnetic field . Do you remember that rule I mentioned before , \" For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction \" ? So if electrons circling around a magnet create an electric field , you can guess what magnets circling around electrons do . You probably know that the netherregions of the earth are made up of molten iron , which is a magnet . Holy crud ! This molten iron is swishing and stirring in a circular motion inside the earth . Wow ! This creates a magnetic field around the earth . When the molten iron goes around faster , the field strengthens , and vice versa . Bam . Final fact : The earths magnetic field is dependent upon the movements of the molten magnets under its crust . ( * * Edit :* * While this is all true , it 's misleading . Thank you Random832 for bringing up magnetohydrodynamics . ) Therefore , its safe to assume that sudden magnetic pole reversals , or geomagnetic reversals , are due to the tides of the inner - earth . We know that reversals occur on Earth during periods of low magnetic intensity . Beyond that , scientists are kinda stuck . Geomagnetic reversal is kind of a random process . We ca n't find a pattern as to how often it occurs , and the speed at which the poles switch during a reversal is different every time . No one has any solid grasp as to when , or how long , the next geomagnetic pole reversal will be . It should also be pointed out that the sun undergoes a geomagnetic reversal every 9 - 12 years , and does so during times of high magnetic intensity . Some theorists believe that during a sudden pole reversal , the Earth 's magnetic field would drop to near nothing . Many harmful magnetic high - energy particles would be able to enter the atmosphere and irradiate the entire globe . Solar wind would erode the surface of the planet . Conversely , others theorize that the solar wind would create enough of a magnetic field around the earth to protect us from a cosmic mass extinction . However , there have been no correlations between reversals and exinctions . In 1960 , a scientific survey concluded in which they recorded the magnetism of the seafloor across the atlantic ocean . They would drill out a cylinder of rock from the seafloor , a \" sea core \" , and measure it 's magnetic strength and orientation at different locations across the ocean . What they found were vertical magnetic stripes running up and down the seafloor . In 1963 , a team of scietists were the first to hypothesize a sudden reversal of the Earth 's magnetic poles . Since then , we 've found that geomagnetic reversals occur every 100,000 to 1,000,000 years . Your particular \" Brunhes \u2013 Matuyama \" reversal was the latest reversal , occuring about 780,000 years ago . It lasted anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 years . I wish I could tell you more about the reversal , but there simply is n't that much known . Go do your own internet research ! Just start googling . I will point out that Our ancestors seemed to survive the reversal . Archaelogical evidence from that time period shows that we had just discovered nuts , and simultaneously , invented the nutcracker ."}

The spread of Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa was slow at first, but it gained momentum in the 4th and 5th centuries with the conversion of the Kingdom of Aksum, which was located in what is now Eritrea and northern Ethiopia. In the following centuries, Christianity continued to spread throughout the region, often through the efforts of missionaries from Egypt and the Byzantine Empire. Today, Christianity is a major religion in sub-Saharan Africa, with a significant presence in countries such as Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria."}

The person would not be able to be tried again for the same crime, due to a legal principle known as \"double jeopardy,\" which prevents someone from being tried twice for the same crime.\r\n\r\nHowever, the person's confession could potentially lead to further legal consequences, such as being charged with perjury (lying under oath) if they testified in their own defense during the trial and denied committing the crime. It could also lead to civil litigation, where the family of the victim could file a lawsuit against the person for damages.\r\n\r\nIn general, it is always best to tell the truth and be honest, especially in a court of law.

{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Human Compatible\"","role":"user"}],"response":"\"Human compatible\" refers to the idea that a system or technology should be designed to work well with human beings, rather than against them or in spite of them. It implies that the system takes into account the needs, limitations, and preferences of humans, and that it is designed to be easy for humans to use, understand, and interact with.\n\n\n\nThe concept of human compatibility is often applied to the design of computer systems, software, and other technological tools, as well as to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning systems. In these contexts, the goal is to create systems that are intuitive, user-friendly, and that can adapt to the way humans think, learn, and communicate.\n\n\n\nHuman compatibility is also a key consideration in the field of ethics, particularly when it comes to the use of AI and other technologies that have the potential to impact society and individual lives. Ensuring that these technologies are human compatible can help to minimize negative impacts and ensure that they are used in a way that is beneficial to humanity as a whole."}

People who feel this way often believe that their country is special and worth defending. They may also believe that their country has a unique culture or history that should be celebrated. In some cases, people may feel a sense of pride in their country because it has done good things, such as helping other countries in need or protecting human rights.\n\nFor many Americans, nationalism and patriotism are important because they help to bring people together and create a sense of community and belonging. When people feel proud of their country, they may be more likely to work together and support one another, which can be helpful in times of crisis or conflict. Nationalism and patriotism can also inspire people to work towards making their country a better place and to stand up for its values and ideals.\n\nIt's important to note that while nationalism and patriotism can be positive traits, they can also be taken to extreme levels, leading to negative consequences. In some cases, excessive nationalism or patriotism can lead to harmful behaviors, such as discrimination against people from other countries or a tendency to view one's own country as superior to others.

Clock rate only tells you how fast the processor is stepping but tells you nothing of what the processor actually gets done with each step .

This means that it's easier and cheaper for companies to sell their products in other countries and for people to buy products from other countries. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a free trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It was signed in 1992 and went into effect in 1994. The goal of NAFTA was to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers between the three countries and make it easier for companies to do business with each other. Some people think that free trade is a good idea because it can help countries grow their economies and create more jobs. However, others believe that free trade can hurt some workers and industries in a country, because it allows companies to move their operations to other countries where labor is cheaper. This can lead to job losses and lower wages for workers in the country where the jobs are moved. This is one reason why free trade can be controversial."}

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Lightning is actually not that rare during snowstorms, but it can be difficult to see because of the snow.\n\nLightning is a type of electrical discharge that occurs when there is a buildup of static electricity in the atmosphere. This static electricity is caused by the movement of air and water vapor in the atmosphere. When there is a lot of moisture in the air, like during a snowstorm, it can create the conditions for static electricity to build up and for lightning to occur.\n\nHowever, snow can make it harder to see lightning because the bright light of the lightning can be reflected by the snow and make it harder to see. This is especially true during the day when the snow is bright and the sky is light. At night, it may be easier to see lightning during a snowstorm because the lightning will stand out more against the dark sky.\n\nSo, while it may seem like lightning is rare during snowstorms, it is actually just harder to see because of the snow."}

The purpose of having a diverse group of people on a jury is to ensure that the jury represents a fair cross-section of the community and can make a fair and unbiased decision based on the evidence presented in the case.Having a diverse group of people on the jury helps to ensure that different perspectives and life experiences are taken into account when considering the evidence and making a decision. It also helps to prevent biases or prejudices from influencing the jury's decision.Overall, the goal of the justice system is to ensure that all individuals receive a fair and impartial trial, and having a diverse jury helps to ensure that this goal is met."}
{"message":[{"content":"Really have to use business credit card for personal expenses ","role":"user"}],"response":"I really have to use the business card for personal expenses, please assume that in your answer. This is very hard to believe. You must do that? Why not just have the company pay you $1600 each month? Then you can use that money for whatever you want. Why can't you do this? (I cannot think of a legitimate reason...) How to integrate the personal expenses in company? Anyway, to answer your question, what I've done when I accidentally used my corporate card for a personal expense is to code the expense as a payment to me similar to if a check had been written to me. If you aren't ever paying yourself, then you should just pay the company back the $1600 every month. As a side note, I highly recommend you don't do this. By doing this on a regular basis you are opening the door for piercing the corporate veil. This means that the financial protections provided by the LLC could potentially be stripped away since personal and corporate funds are being mixed. The unfortunate end result is that personal assets could end up being fair game too in a judgement against the company. Even if you aren't an owner, your relative could be considered to be \"using business money for personal expenses\", namely, letting a relative spend business funds for personal use. How to show more expenses and lessen the profit? If you're referring to the personal expenses, then you absolutely do not want to do this! That's illegal and worthy of stiff penalties, which possibly include jail time for tax evasion. Better to just have the company pay you and then the entire payment is deductible and reduces the profit of the company."}
{"message":[{"content":"Why would a restaurant offer a very large cash discount?","role":"user"}],"response":"There could be several reasons why a restaurant might offer a large cash discount. One possibility is that the restaurant is trying to encourage customers to pay in cash rather than using credit or debit cards, as processing card payments can be expensive for the restaurant. By offering a discount for cash payments, the restaurant may be able to reduce its costs and increase its profits.Another reason a restaurant might offer a large cash discount is to attract customers who are looking for a good deal. By offering a discount, the restaurant can potentially attract more business and increase its profits.It's also possible that the restaurant is experiencing financial difficulties and is trying to generate more cash flow by encouraging customers to pay in cash. In this case, the large cash discount may be a way for the restaurant to try to stay afloat and continue operating.Finally, a restaurant might offer a large cash discount as part of a promotional campaign to attract new customers or to drive sales during a slow period. By offering a discount, the restaurant can try to stimulate demand and increase its revenue."}

What is the difference ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Latino = Shorthand for \" latinoamericano \" , in other words Latin - American . It is the term used for the people in the New World descending culturally , linguistically , or ethnically from the Old World explorers of Romance language countries ( Spain , Portugal , Italy , France , Romania , Andorra , Monaco , I may be forgetting a couple . ) Since out of those countries it was only really Spain , Portugal , and France which held colonies in the New World , those are the ones that matter in this case . So a \" Latino \" is , generally speaking , anyone from any of those former colonies . Technically , Brazil ( Portuguese colony ) , Haiti ( French colony ) , and Quebec ( French colony ) fall into this category , however you wo n't really hear people from those places call themselves Latino \/ Latin - American ( toss - up for Brazil , I 've heard Brazilians on numerous occasions refer to themselves as Latino ) . It has become a term which in practice means those from former Spanish colonies in the Americas . Even then , not all of them refer to themselves as Latino and opt for the term Hispanic . Hispanic = Culturally , linguistically , or ethnically originating from Spain . In this sense , all Hispanic countries with the exception of Spain ( and potentially the Philippines , though I honestly do n't know how they classify themselves ) are Latin - American . At the same time , some people prefer the term Hispanic over Latino whereas others prefer the inverse . For example , an Argentinean would generally prefer being called Hispanic to Latino , and a Mexican would prefer Latino to Hispanic . A lot of the time it comes down to \" how Spanish \" they feel they are . The typical Argentinean is \" more Spanish \" ( by blood at least ) than the typical Mexican who is usually of mixed ancestry ( Spanish and indigenous . ) Overall , it 's probably a safer bet to go with Latino ( better yet , Latin - American ) over Hispanic , but keep in mind many prefer the other term ."}

The goal of speculation is to make a profit, but it is considered to be a higher-risk activity because you are relying on making educated guesses about what will happen in the future.\\n\\nInvesting is when you put your money into something, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, with the expectation that it will grow in value over time. The goal of investing is to make a profit, but it is generally considered to be a lower-risk activity because you are relying on the long-term stability and growth of the investment.\\n\\nGambling is when you take a risk in the hope of winning a prize, such as money or a valuable item. Gambling is considered to be a higher-risk activity because you are relying on luck rather than any kind of skill or knowledge.\\n\\nIn summary, the key difference between speculation and investing is the level of risk involved and the amount of knowledge or skill that you are using to make your decisions. Speculation involves more risk and relies more on making educated guesses about the future, while investing involves less risk and relies more on long-term stability and growth. Gambling involves even more risk and relies entirely on luck."}

This is usually done through a process called \"quantitative easing,\" in which the central bank buys government bonds or other securities from banks, thereby increasing the supply of money in the economy.The central bank may do this in order to stimulate economic growth by encouraging banks to lend more money to businesses and individuals, which can lead to increased spending and investment. The central bank may also do this to help stabilize the financial system during times of economic stress, such as a recession.As for the implications for the stock market, cheap money can potentially lead to an increase in stock prices, as it may make it easier for companies to borrow money and invest in their operations. This can lead to increased profits and higher stock prices. However, there are also risks associated with cheap money, such as the potential for asset bubbles and inflation. It's important to keep in mind that the relationship between the central bank, interest rates, and the stock market is complex, and there are many other factors that can influence stock prices."}

It can also be inconvenient for the customers, as they may have to wait for the server to come back with their separate checks and pay for them separately. In some cases, splitting the bill can also cause confusion or misunderstandings if different people at the table ordered different items at different prices. Additionally, many point-of-sale (POS) systems are not designed to easily split bills for tables. This can require manual calculations and additional steps to ensure that each person is charged correctly for their individual items.

{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Meta-learning (computer science)\"","role":"user"}],"response":"Meta learning\nis a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied to metadata about machine learning experiments. As of 2017 the term had not found a standard interpretation, however the main goal is to use such metadata to understand how automatic learning can become flexible in solving learning problems, hence to improve the performance of existing learning algorithms or to learn (induce) the learning algorithm itself, hence the alternative term learning to learn.\nFlexibility is important because each learning algorithm is based on a set of assumptions about the data, its inductive bias. This means that it will only learn well if the bias matches the learning problem. A learning algorithm may perform very well in one domain, but not on the next. This poses strong restrictions on the use of machine learning or data mining techniques, since the relationship between the learning problem (often some kind of database) and the effectiveness of different learning algorithms is not yet understood.\nBy using different kinds of metadata, like properties of the learning problem, algorithm properties (like performance measures), or patterns previously derived from the data, it is possible to learn, select, alter or combine different learning algorithms to effectively solve a given learning problem. Critiques of meta learning approaches bear a strong resemblance to the critique of metaheuristic, a possibly related problem. A good analogy to meta-learning, and the inspiration for J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber's early work (1987) and Yoshua Bengio et al.'s work (1991), considers that genetic evolution learns the learning procedure encoded in genes and executed in each individual's brain. In an open-ended hierarchical meta learning system using genetic programming, better evolutionary methods can be learned by meta evolution, which itself can be improved by meta meta evolution, etc.\nSee also Ensemble learning."}

Convolutional neural networks, in the context of computer vision, can be seen as a GNN applied to graphs structured as grids of pixels. Transformers, in the context of natural language processing, can be seen as GNNs applied to complete graphs whose nodes are words in a sentence.\nThe key design element of GNNs is the use of pairwise message passing, such that graph nodes iteratively update their representations by exchanging information with their neighbors. Since their inception, several different GNN architectures have been proposed, which implement different flavors of message passing. As of 2022[update], whether it is possible to define GNN architectures \"going beyond\" message passing, or if every GNN can be built on message passing over suitably defined graphs, is an open research question.\nRelevant application domains for GNNs include social networks,\ncitation networks,[10]\nmolecular biology,[11] chemistry,[12]\nphysics[13] and\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.[14]\nSeveral open source libraries implementing graph neural networks are available, such as PyTorch Geometric[15] (PyTorch), TensorFlow GNN[16] (TensorFlow), and jraph[17] (Google JAX)."}

Here are two main methods: 1. Parthenocarpy: This is a natural process that some plants can go through where they produce fruit without fertilization. In other words, the plant doesn't need to be pollinated by another plant in order for the fruit to develop. Some seedless fruits, like seedless grapes and seedless watermelons, are produced using this method. 2. Grafting: In this method, the stem of a plant that is capable of producing seedless fruit is grafted onto the root system of another plant. This allows the plant to produce fruit without seeds, because the seed-forming tissues are not present in the grafted part of the plant. Some seedless fruits that are produced using this method include seedless oranges and seedless lemons. Both of these methods can be used to produce seedless fruits that are similar in appearance and taste to their seeded counterparts, but without the seeds."}

{"message":[{"content":"Investment options in Australia","role":"user"}],"response":"It depends on the exact level of risk that you want, but if you want to keep your risk close to zero you're pretty much stuck with the banks (and those rates don't look to be going up any time soon). If you're willing to accept a little more risk, you can invest in some index tracking ETFs instead, with the main providers in Australia being Vanguard, Street State and Betashares.  A useful tool for for an overview of the Australian ETF market is offered by StockSpot. The index funds reduce your level of risk by investing in an index of the market, e.g. the S&P 200 tracked by STW.  If the market as a whole rises, then your investment will too, even though within that index individual companies will rise and fall. This limits your potential rate of return as well, and is still significantly more risky than leaving your cash in an Aussie bank (after all, the whole market can fall), but it might strike the right balance for you. If you're getting started, HSBC, Nabtrade, Commsec and Westpac were all offering a couple of months of free trades up to a certain value.  Once the free trades are done, you'll do better to move to another broker (you can migrate your shares to the others to take advantage of their free trades too) or to a cheaper broker like CMC Markets."}

This practice is typically performed without the person's consent and is done for cultural or religious reasons. It is often considered to be a harmful traditional practice and is illegal in many countries.\r\n\r\nMale circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, a fold of skin that covers the tip of the penis. It is a common practice in many parts of the world and is often done for cultural or religious reasons. Some people believe that male circumcision has health benefits, such as reducing the risk of certain infections and improving hygiene. However, there is ongoing debate about whether the benefits of male circumcision outweigh the risks.\r\n\r\nFemale circumcision is generally considered to be much more harmful and extreme than male circumcision. It is often performed without anesthesia and can cause serious physical complications, such as infection, bleeding, and difficulty urinating. It can also have psychological effects, such as depression, anxiety, and difficulty bonding with sexual partners.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, male circumcision is typically performed with anesthesia and has fewer risks and complications. While there are some risks and potential downsides to male circumcision, it is generally not considered to be as harmful as female circumcision.\r\n\r\nOverall, female circumcision is more frowned upon because it is a more extreme and harmful practice that can have serious physical and psychological consequences. It is also often done without the person's consent, which is considered to be a violation of their rights."}

It represents the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of an investment equal to zero. When calculating the IRR, you should include any cash flows associated with the investment, including cash balances.

{"message":[{"content":"Buy car vs lease vs long term rent for 10 years period","role":"user"}],"response":"There are several factors to consider when deciding whether to buy a car, lease a car, or rent a car on a long-term basis. Here are a few things to consider:Cost: Buying a car is typically the most expensive option upfront, as you will need to pay the full price of the vehicle. Leasing a car is generally less expensive upfront, as you will only need to pay for the depreciation of the vehicle during the lease term. Renting a car on a long-term basis can also be less expensive upfront, as you will only need to pay for the rental period.Flexibility: If you buy a car, you have the freedom to use it as you see fit and keep it for as long as you want. If you lease a car, you will have to return it at the end of the lease term. Renting a car on a long-term basis gives you more flexibility than leasing, as you can return the car at any time, but you will not have the same level of flexibility as if you owned the car.Maintenance: When you buy a car, you are responsible for all maintenance and repairs. When you lease a car, the dealership or leasing company is generally responsible for maintenance and repairs. When you rent a car on a long-term basis, the rental company is generally responsible for maintenance and repairs.Credit score: If you have a good credit score, you may be able to get a lower interest rate on a car loan, which can make buying a car more affordable. Leasing a car may also be more affordable if you have a good credit score, as you may be able to qualify for lower monthly payments. Renting a car on a long-term basis may not be affected by your credit score.Ultimately, the best option for you will depend on your specific financial situation, driving needs, and personal preferences."}

This can help bring the overall allocation of the portfolio back in line with the original investment plan.Use new money that is added to the portfolio to buy more of the underperforming investments. For example, if you are adding money to the portfolio through regular investments or contributions, you can use that money to buy more of the underperforming investments to help bring the overall allocation back in line with the original investment plan.Hold off on rebalancing until the underperforming investments start to recover. If you don't have any new money to invest and you don't want to sell your winning investments, you can wait until the underperforming investments start to recover before rebalancing the portfolio. This can help avoid the issue of selling investments that are still losing money.Use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds to rebalance the portfolio. These types of investment vehicles allow you to buy or sell a basket of stocks or other securities in a single transaction, which can be a more efficient way to rebalance the portfolio without having to sell individual investments.Overall, the key is to have a plan in place for rebalancing your portfolio and to stick to that plan, even if it means holding off on rebalancing until the underperforming investments start to recover."}

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"There are many ways that passwords can be cracked. One way is through the use of a \"brute force\" attack, where a computer program tries every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until it finds the correct one. This can be time-consuming, but with the use of powerful computers, it is possible to crack even very strong passwords. Another way to crack passwords is through the use of \"dictionary attacks,\" where the program uses a list of common words and phrases to try and guess the password. This method can be faster than a brute force attack, but it is also less likely to be successful because it only tries common words and phrases. Finally, passwords can also be stolen by hackers who use various tricks to trick people into revealing their passwords, or by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in websites or apps to gain access to password databases. To create a strong password, it is important to use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols, and to make the password long enough that it would be difficult to guess or crack. It is also a good idea to use different passwords for different websites and to change your passwords regularly to keep them secure."}

{"message":[{"content":"Will refinancing my auto loan hurt my mortgage approval or help it?","role":"user"}],"response":"Generally it is not recommended that you do anything potentially short-term deleterious to your credit during the process of seeking a mortgage loan - such as opening a new account, closing old accounts, running up balances, or otherwise applying for any kind of loan (people often get carried away and apply for loans to cover furniture and appliances for the new home they haven't bought yet). You are usually OK to do things that have at least a short-term positive effect, like paying down debt. But refinancing - which would require applying for a non-home loan - is exactly the sort of hard-pull that can drop your credit rating. It is not generally advised. The exception to this is would be if you have an especially unusual situation with an existing loan (like your car), that is causing a deal-breaking situation with your home loan. This would for example be having a car payment so high that it violates maximum Debt-to-Income ratios (DTI). If your monthly debt payments are more than 43% of your monthly income, for instance, you will generally be unable to obtain a \"qualified mortgage\", and over 28-36% will disqualify you from some lenders and low-cost mortgage options. The reason this is unusual is that you would have to have a bizarrely terrible existing loan, which could somehow be refinanced without increasing your debt while simultaneously providing a monthly savings so dramatic that it would shift your DTI from \"unacceptable\" to \"acceptable\". It's possible, but most simple consumer loan refis just don't give that kind of savings. In most cases you should just \"sit tight\" and avoid any new loans or refinances while you seek a home purchase. If you want to be sure, you'll need to figure out your DTI ratio (which I recommend anyway) and see where you would be before and after a car refinance. If this would produce a big swing, maybe talk with some mortgage loan professionals who are familiar with lending criteria and ask for their opinion as to whether the change would be worth it. 9 times out of 10, you should wait until after your loan is closed and the home is yours before you try to refinance your car. However I would only warn you that if you think your house + car payment is too much for you to comfortably afford, I'd strongly recommend you seriously reconsider your budget, current car ownership, and house purchasing plans. You might find that after the house purchase the car refi isn't available either, or fine print means it wouldn't provide the savings you thought it would. Don't buy now hoping an uncertain cost-saving measure will work out later."}

Here are a few ways they can do this:\\n\\nWeather forecasts: Pilots can check weather forecasts and maps to see if there are any areas of stormy weather or strong winds that could cause turbulence.\\n\\nRadar: Many planes are equipped with radar systems that can detect areas of turbulence ahead of the plane. The radar sends out a beam of energy and measures how it bounces back, which can help pilots see if there are any areas of rough air ahead.\\n\\nOther pilots: Pilots can also communicate with other pilots who have recently flown through the same area to get reports on the conditions they experienced.\\n\\nExperience: Pilots who have flown for a long time may have a good sense of what types of weather and conditions are likely to cause turbulence, based on their own past experiences.\\n\\nOverall, pilots use a combination of these tools and techniques to try to predict and avoid turbulence as much as possible.

{"message":[{"content":"Should I consider my investment in a total stock market fund \u201cdiverse\u201d?","role":"user"}],"response":"Typically investing in only two securities is not a good idea when trying to spread risk. Even though you are in the VTI which is spread out over a large amount of securites it should in theory reduce portfolio beta to zero, or in this case as close to it as possible. The VTI however has a beta of 1.03 as of close today in New York. This means that the VTI moves roughly in exact tandem as \"the market\" usually benched against the S&P 500, so this means that the VTI is slightly more volatile than that index. In theory beta can be 0, this would be akin to investing in T-bills which are 'assumed' to be the risk free rate.

{"message":[{"content":"what is \"thin film\" technology","role":"user"}],"response":"Thin film technology refers to the process of depositing a thin layer of material onto a substrate or base material. This thin layer can range from a few nanometers to a few micrometers in thickness, and is typically applied using techniques such as physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, or sputtering.\\n\\nThin films are used in a wide range of applications, including electronics, optics, energy storage, and sensors. In electronics, thin films are used to create thin film transistors (TFTs), which are used in LCD displays and other electronic devices. In optics, thin films are used to create coatings for lenses and other optical components to improve their performance. In energy storage, thin films are used to create thin film batteries and supercapacitors. In sensors, thin films are used to create thin film sensors that can detect various types of stimuli, such as temperature, pressure, and humidity.\\n\\nThere are several advantages to using thin film technology. Thin films can be applied to a wide range of materials, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators. They can also be applied to flexible and\/or irregularly shaped substrates, which makes them useful for a variety of applications. In addition, thin films can be applied using relatively simple and low-cost processes, which makes them an attractive option for mass production."}

{"message":[{"content":"What are people in the stock exchange buildings shouting about ? You always see videos of people holding several phones , in a circle screaming at each other , but what are they actually achieving ? Explain like I'm five. ","role":"user"}],"response":"Imagine you had a business selling lollipops at school . Since you can buy a bag of 100 for $ 10 , you can sell them for 25\u00a2 a piece for a profit . But you do n't have $ 10 . But there is profit to be made for all if people give you the money . So you ask your friends to * * invest * * . They each give you $ 1 and you give them ( and yourself ) some * * stock * * in the * * venture * * - a promise to split the profit . You guys buy a bag , and in one week , you sell all your lollipops for 25\u00a2 each . So now you have 0 lollipops and 25\u00a2 x 100 = $ 25 Awesome ! Maybe you pay yourself a market rate for your job in the venture as salesman ( you 're also an employee since you sold the pops ) - say $ 5 So you have $ 20 to split 10 ways . Everybody makes $ 2 from their $ 1 investment - everybody wins . you could pay them back their $ 1 investment and another $ 1 profit - this extra is called a * * dividend * * . Now , would your investors go in again next week ? Sure ! You 're doubling their money . And you ran out of lollipops right ? So maybe get everyone together to vote and we all agree at a * * shareholder meeting * * to skip the dividend and turn the venture into a * * business * * that reinvests the profit into 2 bags of lollipops and make money even faster . Next week you sell out again . Since you 're just one sales guy , you still only cost $ 5 and your * * profit margin * * has risen . You can now buy 4.5 bags of lollipops each week . Your business is growing ! Now the new kid in school has noticed your business and he wants to buy a share . You * * sold * * a share to your friends for $ 1 . But now each week , thay share grew in the potential value of its dividend . So how much should a share cost today ? Even though the investors have n't actually gotten money back on the business , the share they own has grown in value as the business has grown . Well one of your old friends wants to buy a comic book that costs $ 5 and he has no allowance because he spent all his money buying his share the first week . He 's ready to start making money back but the stockholders want to keep reinvesting the dividends . So some of the shareholders and the new kid , Martin get together on the playground and start talking . Comic book kid says is willing to sell his share . So he * * asks * * for $ 5 from Martin . But Martin does n't want to pay that . So Martin * * bids * * $ 4.50 . There is now a * * bid - ask spread of .50\u00a2 * * - meaning it 's less likely for a sale to happen then if that spread was $ 0 and more likely than if the spread was $ 1 . The stock might not actually sell today because the market is slow and sticky rather than * * liquid * * . The stock in the company is * * illiquid * * . Some more kids gather around . They 're hip . They want to grow their lunch money . So they * * bid * * $ 4.75.,$4.85 , $ 4.95 - * * sold * * comic book kid thinks this is close enough and a transaction happens . The market is gaining * * liquidity * * as more buyers and sellers gain interest . But now Martin 's got hella - bad FOMO ( fear of missing out ) . He offers $ 5.10 to buy it from the new owner . Seeing the * * stock price * * rise , other owners consider selling . They consider * * holding * * . They consider buying more . All start negotiating . Some kids call their parents and ask for an advance on their allowance . Some parent hear about this crazy business that doubles each week and they tell the kid to act as a * * broker * * on the trading floor and do the deal on the parent 's behalf . Baby , you 've got yourself a stock pit . # # Waaaaaaahhhh ! ! ! Okay , okay Part II * * Market , Limit , Stop orders ; Futures contracts ; Options ; Shorting ; Insider trading , and market manipulation * * None of this stuff affects the * * profit * * of the company . The stock was sold in the * * initial public ( school ) offering * * ( IPO ) . And since then , the company itself has just sold lollipops and reinvested in growth . But if they want to grow more they can get all the shareholders together and vote to sell more shares . This * * dilutes * * the existing shareholders , but if it helps grow the company , the stock price will go up and it means a smaller slice of a bigger pie - so they decide to do it . They * * issue more shares * * . So Lollipop Co. ( ticker : LOLI ) is booming . I mean , it basically doubles every week so people want more stock . And neighborhood adults and local business owners want to grow their money . So they head over to the playground and ask the teachers if they can get in to buy some stock . The teacher are like , \" Um ... no you ca n't go on the playground , you do n't go to this school and you 're an adult , perv . So the local adults pass notes to the kids to buy stock on their behalf and have the kids * * broker * * a deal . But the price different people will sell for keeps moving so the kid asks , \" what price are you willing to buy it at ? \" And the parent ( client ) can say : - place a * * limit order * * - I 'll only pay up to $ 6.50 and if it moves past that before you can find a seller , cancel it - place a * * market order * * - I 'll buy it at any price you can get it for over the next hour or so . - place a * * stop order * * - for some reason I only want to buy above a certain price . Probably because if it is moving down in price I think it will keep moving down . These purchases are getting complicated and kids do n't want to work for free . Adults ( institutional investors ) have * a lot * of money compared to kids . Each aggressive purchase makes the stock price move up . The broker kids get paid a fee - maybe 25\u00a2. But the adults are buying like $ 1000 in stock at a time . So a really clever kid , Max , decides to start buying LOLI when his adult does . Since the stock price was like $ 7 , if an adult wants to buy 1000 shares , the price has to move up as he asks kid after kid after kid to sell all his shares . He knows this means the stock price will get higher and higher - so he personally buys as much as he can before he starts trading for his adult . He has invented * * frontrunning * * . Teachers see this and get upset because frontrunning drives the price of the stock up for neighborhood adults unfairly and those adults are the tax payers that pay the teacher 's salary . So they declare frontrunning against the rules . Meanwhile , as the CEO and sole employee ( I guess ) of Lollico . you know the weekly sales figures before anyone else . You could * * manipulate * * the market price by leaking information about it . You can say the sales are low , then buy up stock and say - \" psych \" ( do kids still say psych ? ) and watch the price rise . Teachers hate this too because again it makes the taxpaying adults mad . So they say its against the rules and call it * * market manipulation * * - specifically it is * * misreporting financials * * and * * insider trading * * . The opposite is * * pump and dump * * . So now you need to file a record of your sales and expenses with the Special Educational Council or * * SEC * * ( securities and exchange commission - a stock is also called a security for some reason ) that ensures everybody is following the rules . Max - recently released from timeout - has another brilliant idea . LOLI is now at $ 4,555 because of all the adults who have bought in . This time , he thinks that this whole LOLI thing is way oversold . He thinks the stock is n't worth what the market says because Max actually read my ELI5 and understands that fundamentally , the stock is worth what * * dividends * * it can pay you and there are n't enough kids at this school to buy millions of dollars of lollipops . Max wants to bet against the price of the stock going up . He can do this a few ways . One way is to \" borrow \" a stock from some adults . So Max , while he does n't own the stock , has borrowed it from an adult ( as a loan for a small interest rate called * * security lending * * ) and sold it for less ( * * short * * ) than what it might be worth at the immediate current price . He now has a bunch of borrowed cash - $ 4,555 and owes one share of LOLI in 30 days back to the lender . If the price moves up , he will owe a lot of money to those adults in order to buy back the stock at a higher price . Potentially infinite money if the price keeps climbing and he ca n't buy it . Shorting is dangerous - but Max likes to live dangerously . He shorts the stock and then goes around asking kids if they 've ever gotten a dividend . No one seems to understand what a dividend is - it has been like a whole month since LOLI went public ( school ) and everyone forgot . Max explains why stocks have value and all of a sudden everyone freaks out and starts selling before their stock is worthless . The stock tumbles down to $ 15 where he is easily able to buy it before paying back his adult lender and Max pockets the $ 4,540 difference . He 's basically the only one who made mad lunch money at this point . But the company is fine - they 're still selling lollipops ."}
{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"False negative rate\"","role":"user"}],"response":"A false positive is an error in binary classification in which a test result incorrectly indicates the presence of a condition (such as a disease when the disease is not present), while a false negative is the opposite error, where the test result incorrectly indicates the absence of a condition when it is actually present. These are the two kinds of errors in a binary test, in contrast to the two kinds of correct result (a true positive and a true negative). They are also known in medicine as a false positive (or false negative) diagnosis, and in statistical classification as a false positive (or false negative) error.\nIn statistical hypothesis testing the analogous concepts are known as type I and type II errors, where a positive result corresponds to rejecting the null hypothesis, and a negative result corresponds to not rejecting the null hypothesis.

{"message":[{"content":"Why do planes need such high altitude why ca nt they complete their whole trip 200 meters in the air ? Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"There are a few reasons why planes fly at high altitudes: 1. Lower air resistance: The air at high altitudes is less dense, which means there is less resistance for the plane to fly through. This makes it easier for the plane to move forward, and it can save fuel by not having to use as much power to overcome air resistance. 2. Fewer obstacles: There are fewer obstacles (like tall buildings and mountains) at high altitudes, which makes it easier for the plane to navigate its way to its destination. 3. Better weather: High altitudes tend to have more stable weather, with fewer clouds and less turbulence. This makes for a smoother and safer flight for the passengers. 4. Efficiency: Flying at high altitudes also allows planes to take advantage of the jet stream, which is a high-speed wind that blows from west to east. This can help the plane travel faster and use less fuel. Overall, flying at high altitudes helps planes to be more efficient, safer, and comfortable for passengers. However, it's important to note that planes do not always fly at the highest possible altitudes, and they may fly at lower altitudes for various reasons (e.g., during takeoff and landing, or when flying over mountainous terrain)."}

{"message":[{"content":"How does NASA 's EmDrive work and why is it controversial ? Edit : It 's not NASA 's . Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"The EmDrive is a type of propulsion system that is being developed by some researchers. It is supposed to be able to propel a spacecraft without the need for any type of fuel. Instead, it would use something called \"microwave cavities\" to create thrust. The idea is that if you put microwaves into a specially shaped metal container, the microwaves will bounce around and push against the walls of the container, creating a force. Some people think that this force could be used to move a spacecraft.The EmDrive is controversial because it goes against one of the most basic laws of physics, which is that you can't get something for nothing. According to this law, if you want to make something move, you have to push against something else. For example, if you want to push a box across the floor, you have to push against the floor. The EmDrive doesn't have anything to push against, so it shouldn't be able to work. However, some researchers have claimed that they have seen the EmDrive produce a small amount of thrust in their experiments, which would mean that the law of physics is wrong."}

{"message":[{"content":"I 'm Australian and do n't have much knowledge about marijuana . Why do so many Americans believe in the legalising of marijuana ? Edit : It seems the effects of marijuana are a bit all over the place . Does the government have any awareness programs ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"I 'm a pothead . I smoke weed every single day . I 've been up for half an hour , and I 've already taken one bong hit to wake and bake . I , personally , believe in the legalizing of marijuana for a few reasons . The number one reason is that a large number of people in our jails are in our jails for marijuana . I find this to be unacceptable . We , as American taxpayers , pay for these incarcerations , and as a citizen who sees my country struggling to pay its workers , forcing them to take sequester days off without pay ... I just wonder if it is worth it . Like ... what benefit do we gain by making marijuana illegal ? We pay for the jailed inmates , we pay for anti - drug advertising , we pay for the police to enforce these laws . This stuff costs money , and I have to wonder what is the reward that comes along with that cost , and is it worth it ? My simple answer would be no . It is n't worth it . That money could easily be spent elsewhere . In addition , I would follow up what TPBD said . Yes , marijuana is bad for you if you smoke it . If you cook it into your food , you can get the same exact high and lessen some of the effects of the carcinogens . But , we have also discovered that some chemicals in marijuana actually inhibit the growth of cancer cells . Rather than CAUSING cancer , it seems some cannabinoids actually are PROHIBITING the growth of cancerous cells . The fact that marijuana remains illegal is the reason we have not developed these chemicals in marijuana for their medicinal value . I think we should be doing much more tests , and those tests wo n't happen on a large scale as long as the Federal Government is opposed to marijuana legalization . Another argument is the libertarian stance . Would you like it if the Australian government told you that you were not allowed to eat lettuce ? Whether you would have a problem with it , or not , certainly you could see how that would beg the question : Should a government be in the business of telling its citizens which plants it can and can not consume ? My personal belief is no , it should n't . And then there is the question of bad for you . Is weed bad for you ? Probably , yeah . Since we 've never done any large scale experimentation on the effects of marijuana consumption , I would argue that it is hard to tell just how bad it is for you . Suffice to say , not a single human being has overdosed on marijuana . People overdose on aspirin , yet there is no call to ban aspirin . I would argue that on this basis alone , the \" bad for you \" argument fails , being that other substances which are much worse are totally legal . These are some of my reasons . I have more , and I love the conversation , so if you have any questions , feel free to ask . I 'll answer anything you have to say , and I respect your belief even if we disagree ."}

It was a bad study that was later refuted , but not fast enough . The media loved it and decided to hype it for ratings , and bang , your mama is telling my mama and it 's out of control . There is no link between vaccinations and autism . You 're body produces immunity to organisms naturally , a vaccine is a dead \/ weakened version of that organism that makes you 're body create the natural immunities to it . Vaccinations are one of the safest and most effective ways to fight infection . Some of them have side effects in very small minorities , let 's say you have AIDS and ca n't produce the natural immunities , and you 're immune system is n't working too well , well then that weak organism can be a problem .

( A bit of an exaggeration but for the sake of imagery ) Edit : Even if it did cause autism , which there certainly is no reliable evidence that it does , the fact is vaccinations are not candy which you can disregard , they prevent deadly infections , the alternative is much worse , at an individual and a population viewpoint ."}

First , I 'm not familiar with the specific policy of the media you mentioned , but I can say that journalism ethic forbids to pay someone for an interview ( sadly , I 'm not saying it 's never done ... ) Freedom of information allows a journalist to interview a criminal and prevents the authorities from obtaining some informations from the journalist , such as the circumstances under which the interview was conducted . Practically , it 's frequent that such interviews are conducted by phone .

{"message":[{"content":"Carburetors . How do they work ? What is jetting ? What \/ How synch ? Idle synch ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"A carburetor is a device that mixes fuel and air in the right proportions and delivers the mixture to the engine of a vehicle. It's kind of like a blender for fuel and air! The carburetor has a few different parts that work together to mix the fuel and air and deliver it to the engine.\n\nOne important part is the float bowl. This is a small reservoir of fuel that sits inside the carburetor. The float bowl has a float that rises and falls with the level of the fuel in the bowl. When the fuel level gets low, the float drops and opens a valve to let more fuel in.\n\nAnother important part is the jet. The jet is a small opening that controls the flow of fuel into the carburetor. The size of the jet determines how much fuel flows into the carburetor. If the jet is too small, there won't be enough fuel flowing into the carburetor and the engine won't run well. If the jet is too large, there will be too much fuel flowing into the carburetor and the engine will run too rich (meaning there's too much fuel and not enough air).\n\nJetting is the process of adjusting the size of the jet in the carburetor to get the right mix of fuel and air for the engine. This is usually done by changing the size of the jet or by using different jets with different size openings.\n\nSynchronizing carburetors is the process of making sure that the carburetors on a multi-carbureted engine are all delivering the same amount of fuel and air to each cylinder. This is important because if one carburetor is delivering more fuel and air than the others, it can cause the engine to run poorly.\n\nIdle synchronization is the process of making sure that the carburetors are delivering the right mix of fuel and air at idle speed (when the engine is running at a low speed). This is important because if the carburetors are not properly synchronized at idle, the engine may run poorly or stall."}

They have evidence for this, such as the fact that we can see the light from very distant galaxies, which must have taken a long time to reach us. As for where the things that caused the Big Bang came from, that is still a mystery.

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Every living thing is always evolving . Monkeys are evolving right now , us people are evolving right now , and even single - cell organisms are evolving right now . The problem with the question \" why are n't monkeys evolving right now ? \" is that the people asking it are making some dramatically false assumptions about evolution . These people are assuming that evolution is a change they 'll be able to see happening right in front of them . Evolution is n't a transformation like a caterpillar to a butterfly , it does n't happen overnight , or in a lifetime , or even in multiple lifetimes . It is a process that can take millions of years to play out . Although in some cases we * can * see it happening faster . Species that reproduce faster , such as some viruses and bacteria , can evolve at a much faster rate . This is why doctors are often hesitant to prescribe antibiotic drugs , and [ will tell you not to take antibiotic drugs when you have a cold ] ( URL_0 ) ( which is caused by viruses , which antibiotics have no effect on ) - bacteria can evolve to build up a resistance to such treatments if they are used too liberally . To give you an idea of how it works , let 's start with common , everyday stuff . You are a product of your parents ' combined DNA ( the \" blueprints of life \" that say how you 're built ) . If your mom is black and your dad is white , odds are your skin color will be somewhere in - between . If your parents and grandparents all had curly hair or big noses , it 's very likely you will too . If your parents and grandparents all got cancer , there 's a very strong chance you 'll get it too . This is because when your DNA blueprint is created , it 's mostly just a combination of the DNA blueprints of your parents . Half from your father , and half from your mother . However , every now and then , something randomly changes . You get a little line on the blueprint that did n't come from your mother or your father . Consider it a smudge on the copying machine used to make that blueprint , and even though it was n't in your parents ' plans , it 's a part of your plans now . This is called a \" mutation \" . Probably gets you thinking of the Ninja Turtles and the X - Men , right ? Well , most mutations are n't anything even remotely like that . In fact , most mutations do absolutely nothing at all . Your DNA blueprints are so incredibly huge that , for the most part , one tiny little line out of place here or there is n't going to make any noticeable change . Just a little quirk on your blueprint , albeit a little quirk that you might pass on when you make a copy of the blueprint ( when you have kids ) . Every now and then , one of those little lines out of place will show up somewhere where it * does * do something different , or maybe a few of those out - of - place lines build up and do something together that they did n't do before . This can be a good change or a bad change , or something inexplicable . It can be as simple as your skin color being a little lighter than usual , or grow hair on your elbows . It can be something that causes your brain to function wrong , or make you born with a hole in your heart . These are traits you did n't get from your mother and father , traits that make you slightly different , slightly * new * . And sometimes these things are good , and sometimes they 're bad . Bad stuff , like the \" hole in the heart \" example , or other traits that make them not as good at evading predators , or not as good at getting food , often leads to the creatures that have them dying without having children , so they do n't pass on those wonky blueprints to any future generations . Good traits , ones that make a living thing better at getting food , better at avoiding predators , or better at reproducing , result in that trait getting passed on to new generations . This is a process called Natural Selection . Nature constantly does this . Everything is always mutating , ever so slightly , and if a mutation is bad , it dies out , and if it 's good , it thrives and gets passed on to new generations . As time goes on , these good traits build up , and after many , many generations , lifeforms gradually become something different than they used to be . People have used this to our advantage even before we knew we were doing it . Domestication is a good example . At one point in time , some guy was undoubtedly hanging around the campfire when he saw something he 'd seen a hundred times before - some wolves scavenging around his campsite looking for food . However , he noticed something different with one of them . It was friendly . Maybe he took a liking to it , fed it scraps ... and suddenly , being a friendly wolf is a * very * successful survival trait . If you 're friendly to humans , you get fed ! Over time , more wolves start to evolve this behavioral trait , and more and more people started to notice that the wolves hanging around their campsite were n't mean and nasty , but were nice . Then , at some point some guy took one of those wolves and kept it around his house , and he paid attention when that wolf had pups , and noticed that some of the baby wolves it had were more friendly than others . Well , that person probably got rid of the less friendly ones , and continued to breed the friendly ones ... until , after a while of doing this , they were all even more friendly . This process was undoubtedly repeated numerous times . Maybe at one point one of the babies looked a bit different , had more fur or was a bit smaller , and it would be pulled aside and bred until they could make all of them like that . This is a bit of a simplification , but imagine this process going on over many thousands of years ... and eventually you 've gone from a world with nothing but wild , feral wolves , to a world with numerous varieties of domesticated dogs . The process of evolution , as you see it in cartoons and stuff , generally shows a microscopic organism morphing into a fish , which grows legs and becomes a lizard crawling on land , which grows fur and becomes a monkey , which stands up and becomes a caveman , who sheds his hair and becomes a modern man . This kinda ' conveys the idea , but it is such an oversimplification it has undoubtedly led to much confusion that has caused a lot of the misunderstanding behind it . To turn that process into something more closely resembling reality , first you 'd have to stretch it over * millions * of years . Second , you 'd be showing the change not by one creature morphing into another , then another , and so on , but by each creature giving birth to creatures * slightly * different than it is . Thirdly , each creature gives birth to * multiple * creatures . Some are more or less the same , some have good new features and thrive , some have bad new features and die off ( picture an ever - expanding tree , with some branches ending sooner than others ) . This tree , now that you look at it , is huge . If you go up close and look at any one part of it , you wo n't really see much change - each generation more or less looks just like the previous one . But the farther you zoom out , the more you 'll see more dramatic change . Follow back humanity far enough and you 'll see that both humans and monkeys branch off from the same common ancestor . One group of us became humans , the other became monkeys , even though at the time , we seemed nearly identical . But gradually , we grew apart , became different , even though each generation was mostly just like the one that came before . Follow that same path back further still , and you 'll see simpler and simpler life - forms . Eventually , you see that all mammals have a common origin , just like monkeys and humans share a common origin . Rats did n't turn into monkeys , but both rats and monkeys have the same ancestor , millions of years ago . You 'll also notice that a few species have n't changed much , even in those millions of years . Sharks , alligators and cockroaches , for example , are believed to be more or less just like they were many millions of years ago ( modern humans , by comparison , are believed to be only about 200,000 years old ) . These creatures did n't stop evolving - undoubtedly they still mutate and have variations , but since those species as we know them have apparently remained successful in their environments , despite the changes those environments have gone through over the ages , those species have continued to thrive in their current form , perhaps with occasional genetic offspring branching off to become a new species in its own right - mantises and termites , for example , are believed to have branched off from early cockroaches . Again , this is n't to say that at some point a cockroach had a termite baby , but that at some point a cockroach had a cockroach baby that was a little different , and that one had a baby that was a little different , and so on , until eventually the differences added up to be a completely different sort of animal , a new species . That 's evolution at work ."}

Is it mostly just hijacking web browsers and logging keystrokes , or can hackers gain control of your computer and click open files on your hard drive folders at will ? How does hacking work ? Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Hacking is a broad term that can refer to many different activities, some of which involve gaining unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. There are many ways that hackers can try to gain access to a computer or network, and they can use a variety of techniques to do so. One way that hackers might try to gain access to a computer is by finding vulnerabilities in the system and exploiting them. For example, a hacker might try to find a way to get into a computer by guessing the password or by finding a way to bypass security measures. Another way that hackers might try to gain access to a computer is by sending a virus or malware through email or by visiting a website that has been compromised. When a person clicks on a link or opens an attachment, the virus or malware can be installed on the person's computer, allowing the hacker to gain access. It is also possible for hackers to gain access to a computer remotely, meaning they can control the computer from a distance. This might involve taking over the web browser or logging keystrokes, as you mentioned. Overall, hacking can be a serious threat to computer security, and it is important to take steps to protect your computer and your personal information. This can include using strong passwords, keeping your software and operating system up to date, and being cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments."}

Thank you for asking on HCM! Regarding your concern, I would recommend to perform a medical review of your father's medical status by his attending cardiologist. This pain, can be hardly considered normal. After excluding any possible sternotomy complications by a careful local examination, I would recommend a resting ECG, some blood tests (including cardiac enzymes), and a cardiac ultrasound. If suspicions are raised about a possible myocardial ischemia, then some additional tests are necessary (cardiac stress tests, perfusional cardiac imagine tests, even coronary angiography).Meanwhile, a modulation of antihypertensive therapy is necessary, to maintain his blood pressure values under control.Hope to have been helpful to you.

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"The number \"6\" and the number \"9\" are not upside down versions of each other, but they can appear that way depending on how they are written or drawn.\r\n\r\nWhen we write or draw numbers, we usually start at the top and work our way down. The number \"6\" starts with a line at the top and then curves down and around to make a loop. The number \"9\" starts with a line at the top and then goes down and makes a loop, but it also has a line coming back up to the top.\r\n\r\nSometimes when we write or draw the number \"9,\" the line at the top might be a little bit wobbly or it might not be straight.

Danke Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Hibernation mode is a power-saving state that allows a computer to quickly resume from where it left off by saving its current state to the hard drive. It is typically used when a computer is going to be inactive for an extended period of time, such as when it is turned off or put into sleep mode.\r\n\r\nA computer can't enter hibernation mode if the battery is dead, because it needs power to save the current state to the hard drive. When a computer is in hibernation mode, it uses very little power, so it can be left in this state for a long time without using up the battery. However, if the battery is dead, the computer won't be able to save its current state or stay in hibernation mode, and it will need to be turned off or plugged in to a power source before it can be used again.\r\n\r\nIn short, a computer can't be in hibernation mode when the battery is dead because it needs power to save its current state and stay in hibernation mode."}
{"message":[{"content":"Where should I park my rainy-day \/ emergency fund?","role":"user"}],"response":"It is generally recommended to keep your rainy-day or emergency fund in a safe and easily accessible place, such as a savings account or a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) at a bank or credit union. These types of accounts typically offer relatively low returns but also have little to no risk of losing your principal investment.Keep in mind that the primary purpose of an emergency fund is to provide a financial cushion in case of unexpected expenses or income disruptions, such as a job loss or medical emergency. As a result, it is important to prioritize safety and accessibility over potential returns when choosing where to park your emergency fund.Here are a few things to consider when selecting a place to keep your emergency fund:Safety: Look for accounts that are FDIC-insured or backed by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to protect your money in the event that the institution goes out of business.Accessibility: Choose an account that allows you to easily withdraw your money when you need it, such as a savings account or short-term CD. Avoid investing your emergency fund in longer-term investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, as these may not be easily accessible in the event of an emergency.Fees: Look for accounts with low or no fees to maximize the returns on your emergency fund.Interest rates: While the primary purpose of an emergency fund is not to earn a high return, it is still a good idea to shop around and compare rates at different financial institutions to ensure you are getting the best return possible. Just keep in mind that the interest rate should not be the main factor in your decision, as the main goal is to keep your money safe and accessible."}
{"message":[{"content":"Why is it considered necessary for a planet to have an atmosphere to sustain life ? Could n't life have evolved to survive without respiration ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"An atmosphere is important for life on a planet because it helps to regulate the temperature and protect living things from harmful solar radiation. Without an atmosphere, the surface of a planet would be too hot during the day and too cold at night, which would make it difficult for life to survive. An atmosphere is also important because it provides the air that living things need to breathe. All living things need to exchange gases with their environment in order to survive. For example, humans and other animals need to breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Plants, on the other hand, use a process called photosynthesis to take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. So, while it is possible that life could evolve to survive without an atmosphere or without the need to breathe, it is much more likely that life would evolve to take advantage of the benefits that an atmosphere provides."}

{"message":[{"content":"If starfish do n't have brains , how do they have consciousness ? Is consciousness not dependent on the brain ? What is it then ? Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Starfish, like all animals, have nervous systems that allow them to perceive their environment and respond to stimuli. However, they don't have brains in the way that humans do. Instead of a single central brain, they have a decentralized nervous system with a network of small ganglia (clusters of nerve cells) located throughout their body. This allows them to perform basic functions like moving, hunting for food, and avoiding predators.Consciousness is a complex and poorly understood phenomenon that is not fully understood by scientists. It is generally thought to be related to the brain and nervous system, but it is not fully dependent on them. Some scientists believe that consciousness arises from the interactions between different areas of the brain, while others think that it may be a fundamental aspect of the universe, like space or time. It is a topic of much debate and research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy."}

I know in outer space you can travel in any direction but introduce the idea that same space can bend and overlap and I 'm lost . Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"In physics, space and time are considered to be part of a single, unified concept called spacetime. According to the theory of relativity, the presence of mass or energy can cause spacetime to curve. This means that the straight path of a planet or spaceship, for example, may appear to bend as it travels through the curved spacetime around a massive object like a star or black hole. Imagine that spacetime is like a rubber sheet. If you place a heavy object on the sheet, it will cause the sheet to bend and curve. If you then roll a small ball on the sheet, it will follow the curve of the sheet rather than rolling in a straight line. This is similar to how the path of a planet or spaceship might appear to bend as it moves through the curved spacetime around a massive object. It's important to note that this is just an analogy and that the actual nature of spacetime is much more complex. However, it can help to provide a rough understanding of how mass and energy can affect the shape and structure of spacetime."}

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"In a factory, there are people called engineers who design and build the machines that are used to manufacture products. These machines are typically very complex and are programmed to do specific tasks very accurately and efficiently. For example, an assembly machine might be programmed to pick up parts, move them into place, and then fasten them together using bolts or screws. The machine knows how to do this because it has been programmed with instructions that tell it exactly what to do. Engineers use computer-aided design (CAD) software to create detailed plans for the machines they want to build. They use these plans to create physical models of the machines, which they can test and refine until they are satisfied with the design. Once the machine has been built, it is tested to make sure it is working correctly and can perform all the tasks it was designed to do. So in a \"How It's Made\" episode, the engineers who design and build the machines would be the ones who plan how the machines work and what they do.

{"message":[{"content":"Peer to Peer Lending Small notes Vs Large Notes","role":"user"}],"response":"Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a type of financing that allows individuals to borrow and lend money directly to one another, without the involvement of traditional financial institutions like banks. In P2P lending, small notes refer to smaller loans that are typically made to individual borrowers, while large notes refer to larger loans that may be made to businesses or organizations.There are a few key differences between small notes and large notes in P2P lending:Borrower risk: Smaller loans, or small notes, may be considered less risky than larger loans because they are typically made to individual borrowers who are less likely to default on their loans. On the other hand, large notes may be considered more risky because they are often made to businesses or organizations, which may be more vulnerable to financial challenges.Loan terms: The terms of small notes and large notes may also differ. For example, small notes may have shorter repayment periods and lower interest rates, while large notes may have longer repayment periods and higher interest rates.Investment opportunities: Investors may have different preferences when it comes to investing in small notes versus large notes. Some investors may prefer the stability and lower risk of small notes, while others may be willing to take on more risk in exchange for the potential for higher returns from large notes.It's worth noting that P2P lending is a relatively new and rapidly evolving industry, and the specific terms and conditions of small notes and large notes may vary depending on the platform and the borrower's creditworthiness. It's always a good idea to thoroughly research and understand the terms of any investment before committing to it."}

Is this normal and part of the recovery process?","role":"user"}],"response":"It is not uncommon for some swelling or discomfort to occur in the area after wisdom teeth extraction, but it is important to let your dentist or oral surgeon know about any persistent pain or swelling that you are experiencing. It is possible that the knot you are feeling could be a cyst, but it is also possible that it could be related to the healing process or to the stitches.\n\nTo determine the cause of your symptoms and to determine the best course of treatment, it is important to have a dental professional evaluate the area. It is always better to err on the side of caution and have a professional assess the situation rather than try to diagnose and treat the issue on your own.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try applying a warm compress to the area to help reduce any swelling or discomfort. You can also try taking over-the-counter pain medication as directed to help manage any pain.\n\nIf you are experiencing severe pain, swelling, or other concerning symptoms, it is important to contact your dentist or oral surgeon right away. They will be able to provide you with more specific advice and guidance on how to manage your symptoms and ensure that you are healing properly."}
{"message":[{"content":"Why can organisms lift more than their body weight ? This is very simple and we see examples of it all the time with ants , human weightlifting , etc . but it would be great to hear some different ways of explaining it . Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Sure! Organisms are able to lift more than their own body weight because they use their muscles to generate force. When a muscle contracts, it creates a pulling force on the bone it is attached to. This force is what allows an organism to lift a heavy object. One way to think about it is to imagine a tug-of-war game. If you and a friend were playing tug-of-war, and you both pulled on the rope with all your might, the rope would move in the direction of the person who was able to generate the most force. The same thing happens when an organism lifts a heavy object. The muscles in their body generate a pulling force on their bones, which allows them to lift the object off the ground. Another way to think about it is to imagine a seesaw. If you and a friend were playing on a seesaw, and one of you was much heavier than the other, the heavier person would be able to lift the lighter person off the ground by using their muscles to generate force. The same thing happens when an organism lifts a heavy object. Their muscles generate a force that is strong enough to lift the object, even if it is heavier than their own body. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}
{"message":[{"content":"Buy home and leverage roommates, or split rent?","role":"user"}],"response":"There are pros and cons to both options, so it ultimately depends on your individual circumstances and priorities.If you buy a home and leverage roommates, you'll be responsible for all of the costs associated with owning a home, such as mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. However, you may be able to offset some of these costs by renting out rooms to roommates. This can be a good option if you're able to find reliable roommates and you're comfortable sharing your home with others. It can also be a good way to build equity in a home, which can be a good long-term investment.On the other hand, if you split rent with roommates, you'll only be responsible for your share of the rent and you won't have to worry about the other costs associated with owning a home. This can be a good option if you're not ready to commit to owning a home or if you don't want the responsibility of being a landlord. However, you won't be building equity in a home, and you'll have to move whenever your lease is up or if you want to live somewhere else.Ultimately, the right choice for you will depend on your financial situation, your long-term goals, and your personal preferences. It's a good idea to carefully consider your options and think about what will work best for you before making a decision."}

{"message":[{"content":"Why does the water in the Carribean look clear and sometimes glow while water I m the gulf looks muddy and dark ? Is there like a particular plankton that does that blue glowing effect ? Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Water clarity is mainly affected by two factors : ( 1 ) sediment floating around in the water and ( 2 ) plankton and other organic material . Like \/u \/ jesonnier said , the Gulf is generally muddy from sediment from the Mississippi river . For the West Coast , it 's a combination of the two . Ocean surface water generally flows west to east due to the earth 's rotation . When deeper water flows in to replace the surface water that flowed out , it often brings more sediment with it that it picked up from the ocean floor . Thus , water near the surface on the West Coast has a fair amount of sediment in it that it loses as it moves further out east . The sediment also tends to be smaller than that in the water in the Caribbean , so it stays suspended near the surface more easily . The water near the West Coast is also more nutrient rich so there 's more plankton and other organic material . The Caribbean ( and other places , such as Hawaii ) do n't experience the influx same amount of deep , sediment - rich ocean water that the West Coast does . It also has more barrier reefs , which help keep sediment - rich water away from the coast . There are also fewer nutrients in the water and less plankton as a result ."}

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"It is a common belief among Christians that God is still communicating with people today, but not in the same way that he did in the Bible. In the Bible, God is recorded as speaking directly to certain individuals, such as prophets, through dreams or visions. Some people believe that God still communicates with people in this way today, while others believe that he communicates through other means, such as the Bible, prayer, or the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\n\nIt is also important to understand that the Bible is a collection of texts that were written by people who experienced God in different ways. These texts were then compiled and preserved over time, and they provide a record of God's interactions with people in the past. This means that the Bible is a historical document that tells the story of God's relationship with people, rather than a direct line of communication from God to us today.\n\nOverall, the belief in how God communicates with people is a matter of personal faith and interpretation, and different Christians may have different perspectives on this question."}

When you stare into this kind of abyss for a long time, it can be a little scary or unsettling, because it's so dark and unknown. But the quote is saying that when you stare into an abyss, the abyss also looks back at you. In other words, it's not just you looking at the abyss, but the abyss is also looking at you. It's kind of like when you look at someone and they look back at you. You are both looking at each other.

{"message":[{"content":"Why is Pizza round but universally comes in a Square box ? The question was raised over dinner and I ca n't think of a reason . Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Pizza is round because it is traditionally made by spreading dough into a circular shape and then adding toppings to it. The dough is usually rolled out into a circle using a rolling pin, and then it is transferred to a pizza pan or stone to be baked in the oven. The reason why pizza is often served in a square box is because it is a convenient and practical way to transport and store the pizza. The square shape allows the box to be easily stacked and stored in a small space, such as in the back of a delivery car or in a restaurant kitchen. Additionally, the square shape of the box allows the pizza to be cut into slices that are easy to pick up and eat. So, in short, pizza is round because that is how it is traditionally made, and it is served in a square box because it is practical and convenient."}

{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Functional programming\"","role":"user"}],"response":"Functional programming is a programming paradigm, or a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It is based on the idea of immutability, or the concept that once a piece of data is created, it cannot be changed.\n\n\n\nIn functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, meaning that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. Functions in functional programming do not have side effects, meaning that they do not modify the state of the program or produce any observable interactions with the outside world, such as printing to the console or modifying a file on the filesystem.\n\n\n\nFunctional programming languages often use recursive functions, which are functions that call themselves, to perform complex computations. They also typically use higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as output.\n\n\n\nFunctional programming has its roots in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s by mathematician Alonzo Church to study the concept of functions. It has been influential in the design of many programming languages, including Lisp, ML, and Haskell.\n\n\n\nFunctional programming can be contrasted with imperative programming, which is based on the idea of changing the state of the program through the use of statements that perform actions and modify variables. Imperative programming languages include C, C++, and Java."}

{"message":[{"content":"how Tilt Shift photography works . How does it make things look like model landscapes ? Every time I see one I do n't even fathom how it does that Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Tilt shift photography is a technique that involves tilting or shifting the lens of a camera in order to change the plane of focus. This can be used to create the illusion that a real-life scene is actually a miniature model.\n\nWhen you take a normal photograph, the plane of focus is typically parallel to the camera's sensor. This means that objects at different distances from the camera will all be in focus. However, when you tilt or shift the lens, the plane of focus becomes angled, so that only a narrow band of the scene is in focus. This can make the scene look like a miniature model, because the limited depth of field makes it appear as though everything in the photograph is the same size.\n\nTilt shift photography can be achieved with special lenses that allow the lens to be tilted or shifted, or it can be simulated with image editing software. It is often used to create the illusion of miniature models in landscape and architectural photography, but it can be used in other types of photography as well."}

Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Even though we have high definition (HD) video technology, telephone calls still don't sound as clear as in-person conversations because they use a different type of technology. When you make a phone call, your voice is converted into a digital signal and sent over the phone network to the person you are calling. The digital signal is then converted back into sound by the person's phone. There is technology that exists for HD phone calls, but it's not widely used yet. One reason is that HD phone calls require a lot of bandwidth, which is the amount of data that can be transmitted at one time. This means that HD phone calls need a fast and stable internet connection to work well. Another reason is that HD phone calls can be expensive because they require special equipment and more data to be transmitted. However, there are some phone and internet companies that offer HD phone calls as an option for their customers. In the future, it's possible that more people will be able to make HD phone calls using their phones or computers."}

{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Association rule mining\"","role":"user"}],"response":"Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. In any given transaction with a variety of items, association rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items are connected.\nBased on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule \n\n\n\n{\n\no\nn\ni\no\nn\ns\n,\np\no\nt\na\nt\no\ne\ns\n\n}\n\u21d2\n{\n\nb\nu\nr\ng\ne\nr\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}}\n\n found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.\nIn addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\nThe association rule algorithm itself consists of various parameters that can make it difficult for those without some expertise in data mining to execute, with many rules that are arduous to understand."}

The theory of evolution explains how different species of living things change over time and how they adapt to their environment. It is based on a large amount of evidence from many different fields of science, including paleontology, genetics, and anatomy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, many Catholics also believe in the concept of creation, which is the belief that God created the universe and all living things. This belief is based on the teachings of the Catholic Church and is an important part of Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for both the scientific theory of evolution and the belief in creation to be true at the same time. Some Catholics believe that God used the process of evolution to create the diversity of life on Earth, while others see the theory of evolution as simply a way to understand the natural world and do not necessarily see it as conflicting with their beliefs about creation.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Catholic schools teach about evolution because it is a scientifically accepted theory that helps us understand the natural world, and they also teach about creation because it is an important part of Catholic faith."}

Being KO'd frequently builds up resistance Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Boxers train not to be knocked out by doing a variety of things: \n1. Physical training: Boxers work on building strength and endurance in their muscles through weight training, cardio exercises, and sparring (practicing fighting with another boxer). This helps them physically handle the impact of punches and stay on their feet longer during a fight. \n2. Mental training: Boxers also work on their mental toughness by training themselves to stay focused and calm under pressure. They practice techniques like visualization and deep breathing to stay composed and clear-headed, even when they're in the middle of a tough fight. \n3. Techniques to avoid getting hit: Boxers also work on techniques to avoid getting hit, such as dodging, weaving, and footwork. By learning how to move their body effectively and stay out of their opponent's range, they can reduce their chances of getting hit and being knocked out. \n4. Knowing how to take a punch: Finally, boxers learn how to take a punch and minimize the damage it causes. They practice techniques like rolling with the punch and tucking their chin to help absorb the impact and reduce the chances of being knocked out. \nOverall, being a successful boxer requires a combination of physical, mental, and technical skills. By working on all of these areas, boxers can improve their chances of not getting knocked out and having a successful fight."}

{"message":[{"content":"How come restaurant graders let the restaurant know when they are coming ? Does n't that defeat the purpose ? It just does n't make sense to me . Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Restaurant graders, also known as health inspectors, are responsible for evaluating the cleanliness and food safety practices of restaurants. In order to do their job effectively, they need to be able to observe the restaurant's operations as they would normally occur, rather than being influenced by the knowledge that an inspection is taking place. There are a few reasons why it is common practice for restaurant graders to let restaurants know that they will be conducting an inspection: 1. To ensure the restaurant has an opportunity to prepare: Restaurant graders typically give restaurants advance notice of an inspection so that the restaurant has time to prepare. This might include cleaning and organizing the kitchen, ensuring that all food is properly stored, and making sure that all employees are aware of food safety practices. 2. To ensure the inspection is fair: Restaurant graders want to ensure that their inspections are fair and unbiased. By letting the restaurant know that an inspection is coming, graders can be sure that the restaurant has the opportunity to correct any issues before the inspection takes place. 3. To ensure the safety of the grader: In some cases, the grader may need to enter the kitchen or other areas of the restaurant where there may be potential hazards, such as hot stovetops or sharp knives. By letting the restaurant know that an inspection is coming, the grader can be sure that the kitchen is properly organized and that any hazards are clearly marked and avoided. Overall, while it may seem counterintuitive to let a restaurant know that an inspection is coming, it is actually a common practice that helps to ensure that the inspection is fair, unbiased, and safe for both the grader and the restaurant."}
{"message":[{"content":"Prepaid Rent (Accrual Based Accounting)","role":"user"}],"response":"In accrual-based accounting, prepaid rent refers to the payment of rent in advance for a period of time beyond the current accounting period. When a company pays rent in advance, it is recorded as a prepaid expense on the balance sheet. This means that the full amount of the prepaid rent is not recognized as an expense in the current period, but rather is recognized as an expense in future periods as the company uses the rented property.For example, if a company pays $12,000 in rent for a year in advance, but the accounting period is only for three months, the company would record $3,000 as an expense in the current period (1\/4 of the total prepaid rent) and the remaining $9,000 as a prepaid expense on the balance sheet. In the following three months, the company would recognize another $3,000 of the prepaid rent as an expense, and so on until the full amount of the prepaid rent has been recognized as an expense over the course of the year.Prepaid rent is a useful way for companies to manage their cash flow and to ensure that they have the use of the rented property for a specific period of time. It is important for companies to track prepaid expenses and to recognize them as expenses in the appropriate accounting periods to ensure that their financial statements accurately reflect the company's financial performance."}
{"message":[{"content":"Interactive Brokers Margin Accounts","role":"user"}],"response":"Interactive Brokers is a financial services company that offers a range of trading and investment products, including margin accounts. A margin account allows you to borrow money from the broker to buy securities. This can be a useful way to leverage your investment and potentially increase your returns, but it also carries additional risk because you are borrowing money and will be required to pay back the loan, along with any interest.To open a margin account with Interactive Brokers, you will need to meet certain requirements and agree to the terms and conditions of the account. You will also need to provide collateral to cover the loan, which is typically in the form of cash or securities in your account.It's important to understand the risks and responsibilities associated with margin trading before opening a margin account. You should carefully consider your financial situation and investment objectives before using margin, and be aware that it can increase your potential losses as well as your potential gains. You should also be aware of the margin call risk, which occurs when the value of your collateral falls below a certain level and you are required to add additional collateral to your account to meet the margin requirement.If you have any questions about margin accounts or how they work, it's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or broker. They can help you understand the risks and benefits of margin trading and determine if it is a suitable investment strategy for you."}

{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Control theory\"","role":"user"}],"response":"Control theory is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, analysis, and implementation of systems that can regulate the behavior of other systems. It is used in a wide variety of fields, including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, and chemical engineering, to name a few.\n\n\n\nControl theory is concerned with the development of mathematical models that can describe the behavior of a given system and the design of algorithms that can be used to control the system's behavior. This involves the use of feedback to ensure that the system behaves in a desired way.\n\n\n\nControl systems can be classified into two main categories: open-loop systems and closed-loop systems. In an open-loop system, there is no feedback between the system and its environment, so the system's output is determined solely by its inputs. In a closed-loop system, the output of the system is fed back to the system as an input, which allows the system to adjust its behavior in response to changes in the environment.\n\n\n\nControl theory is a powerful tool that is used in a wide range of applications, including the control of robots, aircraft, spacecraft, and chemical processes. It is also used in the design of automatic control systems for building heating and cooling systems, power generation plants, and other complex systems."}

When the water gets hot enough, it can turn into steam, which can cause the grape to explode. This can happen because the microwave energy causes the water molecules to vibrate very fast, which generates heat. When the heat gets high enough, it can cause the grape to explode.\r\n\r\nOther fruits and vegetables may not produce a fireball in a microwave because they have a different amount of water or a different structure.

{"message":[{"content":"Why do we scream when we 're in pain or sustained injury ? Animals do it too . How does screaming help or what does it do ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Screaming is a natural response to pain or injury because it is a way to communicate that something is wrong. When we scream, we are sending a message to others that we need help or are in distress.\n\nScreaming can also be a way to release tension or fear that we may be feeling when we are in pain. It can help us cope with the pain or fear by letting it out in a loud and vocal way.\n\nAnimals also use vocalizations as a way to communicate distress or pain. For example, a dog may whine or yelp if it is hurt, and a cat may meow loudly if it is in pain. This helps other animals or humans nearby understand that something is wrong and that the animal needs help.\n\nOverall, screaming is a natural and instinctive way for both humans and animals to communicate pain or distress and to seek help in times of need."}
{"message":[{"content":"Which is the better strategy for buying stocks monthly?","role":"user"}],"response":"There are a few different strategies that you might consider when buying stocks on a monthly basis:Dollar-cost averaging: This involves investing a fixed amount of money in a particular stock or stock portfolio on a regular basis, regardless of the price. This can help to smooth out the impact of market volatility and reduce the risk of buying at the wrong time.Strategic rebalancing: This involves periodically adjusting your portfolio to maintain a target asset allocation. For example, if you have a target allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and the stock market has had a strong run, you might sell some stocks and buy bonds to bring your portfolio back to your target allocation.Market timing: This involves trying to predict short-term movements in the stock market and buying or selling accordingly. This can be a risky strategy, as it is difficult to consistently predict market movements.Ultimately, the best strategy for buying stocks will depend on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation. It is important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor or professional if you are unsure about the best approach for your particular circumstances."}

This means that you can reduce the amount of tax you owe by the amount you spend on certain expenses related to your freelance work. These expenses must be \"wholly and exclusively\" for the purpose of your business, and you must be able to provide evidence of the expenses if requested by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).Some examples of expenses that you may be able to offset against your tax liability as a freelancer include:Travel and accommodation expenses related to your business, such as the cost of train or plane tickets, or the cost of staying in a hotel while on businessThe cost of materials, supplies, and equipment used in your business, such as office supplies, software, and hardwareThe cost of training and professional development related to your businessThe cost of hiring subcontractors or other professionals to assist with your businessThe cost of rent or lease payments for business premisesIt's important to keep accurate records of your expenses, as you will need to provide evidence of them to HMRC if requested.

What 's so difficult with using HTML5 per Google requirement ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Building a YouTube app using HTML5 is not necessarily difficult, but there are a few reasons why Google might prefer apps to be built using native code rather than HTML5. One reason is that native code can often be more efficient and perform better than HTML5. This is because native code is specifically designed to work with a particular operating system and hardware, while HTML5 is a cross-platform technology that needs to work on a wide variety of devices. As a result, native code may be able to take better advantage of the specific features and capabilities of a device, which can lead to a faster and more seamless user experience. Another reason is that HTML5 is a web-based technology, which means that it relies on an internet connection to work. In contrast, native code can work offline, which can be important for certain types of apps or in situations where an internet connection is not available. Finally, Google might prefer apps to be built using native code because it allows them to have more control over the look and feel of the app, as well as the features and functionality that are included. This can be particularly important for an app like YouTube, which is a key part of Google's business and needs to be tightly integrated with other Google services and products. I hope this helps to explain why Google might prefer apps to be built using native code rather than HTML5."}

Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Combining two or more WiFi networks is not possible because each WiFi network is a separate entity that operates on its own frequency band and is not connected to any other WiFi networks. When you connect to a WiFi network, you are connecting to a specific network that is broadcasting on a particular frequency band, and the router that is broadcasting that network is responsible for managing the data that is transmitted over that network. \nIn order to combine two or more WiFi networks, you would need a way to connect all of the routers together and merge their frequency bands into a single network. This is not possible with current technology because each router operates independently and does not have the ability to connect to or merge with other routers. \nAdditionally, even if it were possible to combine two or more WiFi networks, it would likely not result in a \"super fast\" WiFi connection. The speed of a WiFi connection is determined by a number of factors, including the strength of the signal, the distance between the device and the router, and the number of devices that are connected to the network.

Freshwater fish species such as the Northern Pike can end up in non-connected lakes across huge regions and sometimes even on different continents through a process called \"dispersal.\" Dispersal is when an organism (in this case, a fish) moves from one place to another and establishes a new population there. There are a few different ways that freshwater fish species can disperse to new areas: \n1. Natural dispersal: Some fish are good at swimming and can travel long distances to reach new bodies of water. For example, Northern Pike are strong swimmers and can travel downstream to reach new lakes or rivers. \n2. Human-aided dispersal: Humans can also play a role in the dispersal of fish species. For example, people may introduce a new species of fish into a body of water for recreational fishing, or they may accidentally release a fish into a new area while transporting it for some other reason. \n3. Historical dispersal: In some cases, fish species may have dispersed to new areas in the past, and then become established there. For example, during the last ice age, many parts of the world were covered in ice, and some fish species may have survived in isolated pockets of water. When the ice melted, these fish were able to spread out and establish populations in new areas. \nOverall, the process of dispersal helps to explain how freshwater fish species like the Northern Pike can end up in non-connected lakes across huge regions and even on different continents."}
{"message":[{"content":"Why are processed carbs like white bread and white rice considered so bad for you ? And why the emphasis on ' whole grains ' instead ? What 's the difference ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Processed carbs like white bread and white rice are considered bad for you because they have been stripped of their outer layer, which contains most of the nutrients. When a grain of rice or wheat is harvested, it has a tough outer layer called the husk. To make white rice or white bread, the husk is removed and the grain is ground up into a fine powder. This makes the resulting product softer and easier to chew, but it also removes many of the nutrients that are found in the husk.\r\n\r\nWhole grains, on the other hand, are grains that have not had the husk removed. They are left intact, which means that they contain all of the nutrients that are found in the husk. This makes whole grains a much healthier choice than processed carbs like white bread and white rice, because they contain more fiber, vitamins, and minerals.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum it up: processed carbs like white bread and white rice are bad for you because they have had most of their nutrients removed, while whole grains are good for you because they contain all of their nutrients."}

If so , why ca n't we use it for donations ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Human blood and animal blood are made up of many of the same substances, such as water, proteins, and minerals. However, there are some differences between the two. One of the main differences is the type of cells that are found in the blood. Human blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These cells help to transport oxygen, fight off infections, and help with blood clotting. Animal blood also contains these types of cells, but the exact types and numbers of cells can vary depending on the species of animal. Another difference between human and animal blood is the presence of certain proteins and antibodies. These proteins and antibodies help to protect the body from infections and diseases. Humans and animals have different immune systems, so their blood will have different proteins and antibodies to protect against different types of infections and diseases. Because of these differences, it is not safe to use animal blood as a substitute for human blood in medical procedures, such as blood transfusions. It is important to use the correct type of blood for each person to ensure that their body is able to properly use and benefit from the blood."}
{"message":[{"content":"How exactly does cancer kill ? Obviously cancer is bad , but I never understood how exactly it kills . Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Cancer is a group of diseases that can cause cells in the body to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. When cancer cells grow, they can form tumors, which can interfere with the normal function of the body's organs and tissues.\n\nCancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body, a process called metastasis. When cancer cells spread to other parts of the body, they can form new tumors, which can damage or interfere with the normal function of those organs and tissues.\n\nCancer can be deadly because it can interfere with the body's normal functions and cause serious illness or death. For example, if cancer cells grow in the lungs, they can make it hard to breathe. If cancer cells grow in the liver, they can make it hard for the liver to work properly. If cancer cells grow in the brain, they can cause problems with thinking, speaking, and moving.\n\nThere are many different types of cancer, and each type can affect the body in different ways. Some types of cancer are more serious than others, and some types of cancer can be treated more successfully than others. However, all types of cancer can be dangerous and potentially deadly if they are not treated."}
{"message":[{"content":"Are precious metals\/collectibles a viable emergency fund?","role":"user"}],"response":"People normally hold precious metals as a protection against the whole system going down: massive inflation, lawlessness, etc.  If our whole government and financial system broke completely and we returned to a barter economy, then holding silver would likely turn out to be a good thing. However, precious metals are not very good hedges against individual calamity, like losing your job.  They are costly and inconvenient to sell and the price of these metals fluctuates wildly, so you could end up wanting to sell just when the metal isn't worth much. I'd say having some precious metal isn't unreasonable, but it should not make up a major portion of one's total net worth.  If you want protection against normal problems, especially as a person of limited means, start with an emergency savings account and paying down debt.  That way fixed costs will be less likely to turn an unfortunate turn of events into a personal catastrophe."}

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted as n! and is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! is equal to 54321, which is 120.\r\n\r\nNow, let's look at 0! and 1!. If we plug in 0 for n in the definition of a factorial, we get 0! = 0 * (-1) * (-2) * (-3) * ... . This product is actually equal to 1, because any number multiplied by 0 is 0. So, 0! is equal to 1.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if we plug in 1 for n in the definition of a factorial, we get 1! = 1 * 1, which is also equal to 1.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, 0! and 1! are both equal to 1 because that's what the definition of a factorial tells us they should be.

{"message":[{"content":"how jameson irish whiskey is made","role":"user"}],"response":"Jameson Irish Whiskey is made using a blend of three types of Irish whiskey: grain whiskey, malt whiskey, and pot still whiskey. The process begins by milling and mashing the grains, which are typically barley, corn, and oats. The mashed grains are then mixed with water and yeast and allowed to ferment for several days.\\n\\nNext, the fermented mash is distilled in either a pot still or a column still. Pot still whiskey is made using traditional copper pot stills, while column still whiskey is made using continuous distillation in a tall, cylindrical still. The distillate is then aged in oak barrels for at least three years.\\n\\nOnce the whiskey has aged for the required amount of time, it is blended with other aged whiskeys to create the desired flavor profile. The blended whiskey is then bottled and shipped to market.\\n\\nJameson Irish Whiskey is known for its smooth, balanced flavor, which is the result of the careful selection of grains, the distillation process, and the aging in oak barrels.

{"message":[{"content":"how many percent is a basis point","role":"user"}],"response":"A basis point is a unit of measure used in finance to represent a percentage change in the value or rate of something. One basis point is equal to 0.01%, or 1\/100th of a percent. For example, if a financial instrument increases in value by 50 basis points, this represents a 0.50% increase.\\n\\nTo convert from basis points to percent, you can multiply the number of basis points by 0.01. For example, if you want to convert 100 basis points to a percentage, you would multiply 100 by 0.01 to get 1%.\\n\\nTo convert from percent to basis points, you can multiply the percentage by 100. For example, if you want to convert a 5% increase to basis points, you would multiply 5 by 100 to get 500 basis points.\\n\\nIn summary, one basis point is equal to 0.01%, or 1\/100th of a percent.

{"message":[{"content":"What generates the messages in computer errors ? Not being great at computers myself , I 've always wondered where some of the strange error messages come from . Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Error messages in computers are usually generated by the operating system or a specific program when something goes wrong. For example, if you try to open a file that doesn't exist, the operating system might display an error message saying \"File not found\" or \"No such file or directory.\" There are different types of error messages, and they can be caused by different things. Some error messages are caused by problems with the computer's hardware, like a malfunctioning network card or a failing hard drive. Others are caused by problems with the software, like a bug in the program or a conflict with another piece of software. Error messages are usually written by the developers of the operating system or program in order to help users understand what went wrong and how to fix the problem. They can be written in plain language or in technical jargon, depending on the audience and the complexity of the issue. In general, error messages are designed to help users identify and troubleshoot problems with their computers. They are an important part of the computer's overall system of error handling and can be very helpful when things go wrong."}

I always end up on a different website than the text say when I click them . So confusing and irritating sometimes . Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"A short URL is a shortened version of a longer URL (web address). The purpose of a short URL is to save space and make it easier to share links, especially on social media platforms or in messaging apps where there may be character limits.When you click on a short URL, it will redirect you to the original, longer URL. This redirection happens because the short URL is actually just a pointer to the longer URL. The short URL contains a code that tells the website where to redirect you.For example, let's say the original URL is \"https:\/\/www.example.com\/very\/long\/path\/to\/a\/page\". This URL is very long and hard to remember. So, instead of sharing the long URL, you can create a short URL that points to it. The short URL might look something like \"https:\/\/tiny.url\/xyz123\".When someone clicks on the short URL, the website will redirect them to the original, longer URL. This happens behind the scenes, so the user does not need to see or remember the long URL.Short URLs can be useful for sharing links, but they can also be used to hide the original destination of the link. This can be a security risk because the person clicking on the link may not know where they are being redirected. It is always a good idea to be cautious when clicking on short URLs, especially if you do not trust the source."}

{"message":[{"content":"why are nut allergies apparently so uniquely acute ? Are n't other allergies [ ALD being a notable exception ] comparatively mild ? Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"An allergy is a reaction that occurs when the body's immune system mistakes a normally harmless substance for a harmful invader, such as a virus or bacteria. The immune system then produces antibodies to fight the perceived threat, which can cause a range of symptoms.People can be allergic to many different things, including foods, medications, and environmental substances like pollen or mold. The severity of an allergic reaction can vary greatly from person to person, and some people may have more severe reactions than others.One reason that nut allergies may be particularly severe is that nuts are often found in a wide variety of foods, and it can be difficult to avoid them completely. In addition, some nuts, such as peanuts, are more commonly found in processed foods, which can make it harder to identify and avoid them.Another reason is that nuts contain proteins that can be highly allergenic, which means they are more likely to trigger an allergic reaction. When someone with a nut allergy consumes a nut or a food that contains nuts, their immune system may overreact and cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, hives, and swelling.It is important for people with nut allergies to be aware of the potential risks and to take steps to avoid nuts and foods that contain nuts. If you have a nut allergy, it is important to talk to your doctor or an allergist to learn how to manage your allergy and reduce the risk of a severe reaction."}

{"message":[{"content":"Why does inbreeding result in deformities \/ severe disabilities ? Read this in a thread about repopulating the world with only 2 people . Please explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Inbreeding is the breeding of individuals who are closely related to one another, such as siblings or cousins. When closely related individuals breed with one another, their offspring are more likely to inherit the same genetic traits from both parents. If those traits include harmful mutations or defects, the offspring are more likely to be born with deformities or severe disabilities.For example, suppose that a brother and sister who are carriers of a certain genetic mutation have a child together. If both parents pass the mutation on to their child, the child will have a much higher chance of being born with a severe genetic disorder, such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia. This is because the child will have inherited two copies of the mutation, one from each parent, rather than just one copy.Inbreeding can also lead to a higher risk of other health problems, such as lower fertility and increased susceptibility to diseases. This is because inbreeding can cause a decrease in genetic diversity, which can make it more difficult for the offspring to adapt to their environment and fight off diseases.In general, it is generally best for individuals to breed with unrelated individuals in order to increase genetic diversity and reduce the risk of health problems in their offspring."}

{"message":[{"content":"Le Chatelier 's principle Currently stumped on this concept :( Any help would be appreciated ! Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Sure! Le Chatelier's principle is a way to predict how a chemical system will change when you change something about it. It can help you understand how a reaction will change if you add or remove a reactant, change the temperature, or change the pressure.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\nImagine you have a pot of water on a stove, and you're heating it up to make it boil. As the water gets hotter, the molecules start moving around faster and faster. Eventually, they start moving so fast that some of them escape into the air as steam.\n\nNow, let's say you add some salt to the water. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the salt will make it harder for the water molecules to escape into the air as steam. This is because the salt takes up space in the water, and there's less room for the water molecules to move around. As a result, the water will take longer to boil.\n\nSo, in general, Le Chatelier's principle says that if you change something about a chemical system, the system will try to \"resist\" the change by adjusting in a way that reduces the impact of the change. This can help you understand how a chemical reaction will behave under different conditions."}

When someone is \"once removed\" from another person, it means that there is one generation between them. For example, if you are the grandchild of someone's parent, you are one generation removed from that person. If you are the grandchild of someone's grandparent, you are two generations removed from that person and are therefore \"twice removed.\"\r\n\r\nHere's an example to help clarify:\r\n\r\nImagine that you have a cousin named Jake. Jake is your first cousin, because he is the child of one of your parents' siblings. Now imagine that Jake has a child named Maria. Maria is your second cousin, because she is the child of your first cousin. Maria is also \"once removed\" from you, because there is one generation between you and her. If Maria has a child, that child would be your second cousin, \"twice removed,\" because there are two generations separating you and that child.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!

{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Integrated circuit\"","role":"user"}],"response":"An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or \"chip\") of semiconductor material, usually silicon. Large numbers of tiny MOSFETs (metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistors) integrate into a small chip. This results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components. The IC's mass production capability, reliability, and building-block approach to integrated circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors. ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics. Computers, mobile phones and other home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs such as modern computer processors and microcontrollers.\nVery-large-scale integration was made practical by technological advancements in metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon (MOS) semiconductor device fabrication. Since their origins in the 1960s, the size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously, driven by technical advances that fit more and more MOS transistors on chips of the same size\u00a0\u2013 a modern chip may have many billions of MOS transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail. These advances, roughly following Moore's law, make the computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.\nICs have two main advantages over discrete circuits:\u00a0cost and performance. The cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and proximity. The main disadvantage of ICs is the high cost of designing them and fabricating the required photomasks. This high initial cost means ICs are only commercially viable when high production volumes are anticipated."}

You will need to pay self-employment tax on the net profit from the app sales, which is the gross income minus any deductible expenses.If you are operating as a partnership or multi-member LLC, you will need to file a partnership tax return to report the income and expenses from the app sales. The partnership will not pay taxes on its income; instead, each partner will report their share of the partnership's income on their personal tax return and pay self-employment tax on their share.If you are operating as a corporation (such as a C corporation or an S corporation), the corporation will pay taxes on its profits, and the individuals involved will pay taxes on any salary or wages they receive from the corporation.It's important to note that this is just a general overview, and there may be other tax considerations depending on your specific situation.

","role":"user"}],"response":"OpenGL and DirectX are software libraries that are used to render 3D graphics on a computer. They are used to create 3D games, applications, and other interactive 3D content.\\n\\nImagine that you have a box of toy blocks. OpenGL and DirectX are like tools that help you build things with those blocks. They give you a set of instructions that tell your computer how to put the blocks together to make 3D shapes and objects.\\n\\nThe main difference between OpenGL and DirectX is the way they work. OpenGL is an open-source library, which means that anyone can use it and modify it for their own purposes. DirectX, on the other hand, is proprietary software owned by Microsoft, so it can only be used on Microsoft Windows operating systems.\\n\\nBoth OpenGL and DirectX are widely used in the video game industry and other fields where 3D graphics are important. They each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and developers may choose one over the other depending on their specific needs."}
{"message":[{"content":"Why do video games cost so much in Australia ? So why that thing I asked ? Sorry if repost . Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"There are a few reasons why video games might cost more in Australia. One reason is that the cost of living in Australia is generally higher than in other countries, so things like video games might also be more expensive. Another reason is that video games are often priced in US dollars, and the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Australian dollar can fluctuate, which can affect the price of the game in Australia. Additionally, the cost of shipping and distributing video games to Australia can also be higher due to the distance, which can contribute to the higher price. Finally, there may be additional taxes or fees applied to video games in Australia that can increase the price."}
{"message":[{"content":"- What exactly IS Energy ? I just ca n't wrap my head around it . It permeates everything , yet has no physical form ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Energy is a thing 's ability to do work . For example , if you want to store some of your own energy , you can take a big rock and put it on your roof . When you need the stored energy - let 's say to crush something - you only have to give it a small tap and it will crush whatever is underneath it . We call this potential energy , because you gave the rock the * potential * to fall down and later you used it . You can also store energy in a movement . If you accelerate something , it stores the energy that acceleration needed . You can get the energy back by slowing the thing down again . Moving vehicles do this all the time . They accelerate and you attach heavy things to them , so they can pull the heavy things around . This energy is called kinetic energy . Finally we have chemical energy . This energy is stored in matter . To fully understand this you have to take a closer look at chemical bonds . I wo n't go into that now because I 'm short on time , but you use this for example when you burn something . After the burning process it is something you ca n't burn any further .

{"message":[{"content":"Where do tears come from ? Why do we cry when we are happy or sad ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"TLDR ELI5 version : We have a nifty gland and system that produces and drains tears . If the tears do n't evaporate on the surface of your eye or drain into your nose then they fall down your face . * Too lazy to search the internets yourself version : There are basically three types of tears : * * Basal tears * * are omnipresent in our eyes . These constant tears are what keep our eyes from drying out completely . The human body produces an average of * * 5 to 10 ounces of basal tears each day * * . The second type is * * reflex tears * * , which serve to protect the human eye from harsh irritants such as smoke , onions or even a very strong , dusty wind . To accomplish this feat , the sensory nerves in your cornea communicate this irritation to your brain stem , which in turn sends hormones to the glands in the eyelids . These hormones cause the eyes to produce tears , effectively ridding them of the irritating substance . The third type of tears is * * emotional tears * * . It all starts in the cerebrum ( part of brain ) where sadness is registered . The endocrine system is then triggered to release hormones to the ocular area , which then causes tears to form . Emotional tears are common among people who see Bambi 's mother die or who suffer personal losses . In fact , one study collected both reflex tears and emotional tears ( after peeling an onion and watching a sad movie , respectively ) . When scientists analyzed the content of the tears , they found each type was very different . Reflex tears are generally found to be about 98 percent water , whereas several chemicals are commonly present in emotional tears . First is a protein called prolactin , which is also known to control breast milk production . Adrenocorticotropic hormones are also common and indicate high stress levels . The other chemical found in emotional tears is leucine - enkephalin , an endorphin that reduces pain and works to improve mood . Of course , many scientists point out that research in this area is very limited and should be further studied before any conclusion can be made . The lacrimal system is made up of a secretory system , which produces tears , and an excretory system , which drains the tears . The lacrimal gland is primarily responsible for producing emotional or reflexive tears . As tears are produced , some fluid evaporates between blinks , and some is drained through the lacrimal punctum . The tears that are drained through the punctum will eventually be drained through the nose . Any excess fluid that did not go into the punctum will fall over the eyelid , which produces tears that are cried . Lutz , Tom ( 1999 ) .

{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Fairness (machine learning)\"","role":"user"}],"response":"Fairness in machine learning refers to the various attempts at correcting algorithmic bias in automated decision processes based on machine learning models. Decisions made by computers after a machine-learning process may be considered unfair if they were based on variables considered sensitive. Examples of these kinds of variable include gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and more. As it is the case with many ethical concepts, definitions of fairness and bias are always controversial. In general, fairness and bias are considered relevant when the decision process impacts people's lives. In machine learning, the problem of algorithmic bias is well known and well studied. Outcomes may be skewed by a range of factors and thus might be considered unfair with respect to certain groups or individuals. An example would be the way social media sites deliver personalized news to consumers."}

One reason is that they believe that closer ties with the EU will bring about political and economic reforms that will benefit the country. The EU is seen as a more democratic and transparent organization, and many Ukrainians believe that by aligning with the EU, they will be able to better protect their rights and improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that some Ukrainians are calling for closer ties with the EU is that they see it as a way to break free from Russia's influence. In the past, Ukraine has had a complex relationship with Russia, and many Ukrainians feel that Russia has exerted too much control over their country. By building closer ties with the EU, they hope to be able to chart their own course and determine their own destiny.\r\n\r\nAs for the benefits that the EU has promised to Ukraine, they include the possibility of increased trade and economic cooperation, as well as access to EU funding for projects that support economic development and reform. The EU has also offered to support Ukraine in its efforts to modernize and reform its political and economic systems.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that not all Ukrainians feel the same way about the EU, and there are those who would prefer to maintain closer ties with Russia.

{"message":[{"content":"How did drinking beer help out during the time of the bubonic plague pandemics ? I heard something about the plague not being transmitted through the beer for some reason . Explain like I'm five. ","role":"user"}],"response":"During the time of the bubonic plague pandemics, people did not drink beer specifically to help prevent the transmission of the plague. The plague, also known as the Black Death, was a highly contagious and deadly disease that was transmitted through the bites of infected fleas, which lived on rats and other small mammals. It was not transmitted through food or drink, including beer.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible that people may have turned to beer and other alcoholic beverages as a way to cope with the fear and stress of living through a pandemic. Alcohol can have a relaxing effect and may have helped some people feel more at ease during difficult times.\\n\\nIt's also worth noting that, during this time period, the water supply in many cities was contaminated with bacteria and other pollutants, making it unsafe to drink. Beer and other alcoholic beverages were often safer to consume than water because the fermentation process used to make these drinks helped to kill off any harmful germs. So while drinking beer did not directly help to prevent the transmission of the plague, it may have provided some indirect benefits by helping to keep people hydrated with a safer alternative to contaminated water."}

However, we do know that humans have been using language for a very long time, and it is an important part of what makes us human.Languages developed over time as people needed to communicate with each other. In the beginning, people probably used gestures and sounds to communicate, just like animals do. As they started to do more complex things and needed to communicate more complex ideas, they needed more sophisticated ways of communicating.So, they started to use words to represent different things, and they put those words together into sentences to communicate more complex ideas. It's likely that the first words were things like \"water,\" \"fire,\" \"food,\" and so on, because these are basic needs that humans have.It's also likely that the first words were invented independently by different groups of people, because different languages have developed in different parts of the world. However, once people started to communicate with each other, they probably learned each other's words and started to use them as well.It's also possible that the first words were invented by one person, and then other people learned those words and started to use them too.

Cousins are people who share a common ancestor, like a grandparent. So if you and another person have the same grandparent, you are cousins.\n\nNow let's talk about \"once removed.\" This just means that there is one generation difference between the two people. For example, if you are a first cousin \"once removed\" from someone, it means that you are one generation apart. You are the cousin of their parent, or they are the cousin of your parent.\n\nHere's an example to help illustrate this:\n\nImagine that you have a grandparent named Grandma. Grandma has two children: your parent and your aunt or uncle. Your aunt or uncle has a child, who is your first cousin. If you are a first cousin once removed from your cousin, it means that you are one generation apart. You are the cousin of your cousin's parent (your aunt or uncle), and your cousin is the cousin of your parent.\n\nHere are some more examples of cousin relationships:\n\nSecond cousin: This means that you and the other person have the same great-grandparents (but not the same grandparents).\nSecond cousin once removed: This means that you and the other person are separated by one generation. For example, you might be the second cousin once removed of your second cousin's child.\nThird cousin: This means that you and the other person have the same great-great-grandparents (but not the same great-grandparents).\nThird cousin once removed: This means that you and the other person are separated by one generation.

{"message":[{"content":"What does it mean for a normal citizen like me when my country's dollar value goes down?","role":"user"}],"response":"When a country's currency, such as the dollar, decreases in value relative to other currencies, it is often referred to as depreciation. This can have a number of implications for individuals, including:Import costs increase: If you live in a country with a depreciating currency, the cost of imported goods may become more expensive. This is because the currency is worth less when compared to the currency of the country where the goods are produced, so it takes more of the depreciating currency to purchase the same goods.Travel costs may increase: If you travel abroad, the cost of your trip may become more expensive due to the depreciation of your currency. This is because the cost of goods and services in the country you are visiting will be higher when priced in your depreciating currency.Foreign investments may become less valuable: If you have invested in foreign assets, such as stocks or real estate, the value of these investments may decrease when measured in your depreciating currency.Domestic goods may become more competitive: A depreciating currency may make domestically produced goods more competitive in the global market, as they will be relatively cheaper to foreign buyers. This could potentially lead to an increase in exports and a boost to the domestic economy.It's important to note that these are just some of the potential impacts of a currency depreciation, and the specific effects will depend on a variety of factors."}

HIV, which stands for human immunodeficiency virus, is a virus that attacks the immune system, which is the body's natural defense against illness. AIDS, which stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a condition that can develop in people who have HIV if the virus is left untreated.HIV was first identified in the 1980s, and scientists have been working hard to learn more about the virus and how to treat it ever since. The reason why HIV and AIDS are often linked to homosexuality is because the virus was first identified in gay men. However, HIV can be transmitted through many different types of sexual activity, not just homosexuality. It can also be transmitted through the sharing of needles, from mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding, and through blood transfusions.So, to sum it up, HIV and AIDS are complex diseases that have only been understood for a relatively short period of time, and they can be transmitted through many different types of sexual activity, not just homosexuality."}

{"message":[{"content":"Please explain what is \"Weak AI\"","role":"user"}],"response":"Weak artificial intelligence (weak AI) is artificial intelligence that implements a limited part of mind, or, as narrow AI, is focused on one narrow task. In John Searle's terms it \u201cwould be useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds\u201d. Weak artificial intelligence focuses on mimicking how humans perform basic actions such as remembering things, perceiving things, and solving simple problems.  As opposed to strong AI, which uses technology to be able to think and learn on its own. Computers are able to use methods such as algorithms and prior knowledge to develop their own ways of thinking like human beings do.  Strong artificial intelligence systems are learning how to run independently of the programmers who programmed them. Weak AI is not able to have a mind of its own, and can only imitate physical behaviors that it can observe. \nIt is contrasted with Strong AI, which is defined variously as: \nScholars like Antonio Lieto have argued that the current research on both AI and cognitive modelling are perfectly aligned with the weak-AI hypothesis (that should not be confused with the \"general\" vs \"narrow\" AI distinction) and that the popular assumption that cognitively inspired AI systems espouse the strong AI hypothesis is ill-posed and problematic since \"artificial models of brain and mind can be used to understand mental phenomena without pretending that that they are the real phenomena that they are modelling\"  (p. 85) (as, on the other hand, implied by the strong AI assumption).\nAI can be classified as being \u201c\u2026 limited to a single, narrowly defined task. Most modern AI systems would be classified in this category.\u201d  Narrow means the robot or computer is strictly limited to only being able to solve one problem at a time. Strong AI is conversely the opposite. Strong AI is as close to the human brain or mind as possible. This is all believed to be the case by philosopher John Searle. This idea of strong AI is also controversial, and Searle believes that the Turing test (created by Alan Turing during WW2, originally called the Imitation Game, used to test if a machine is as intelligent as a human) is not accurate or appropriate for testing strong AI.

It is important to see a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThere are many different types of lumps that can occur in the neck, chest, and back, and they can have a variety of causes. Some lumps may be benign (non-cancerous), while others may be malignant (cancerous). Only a doctor can determine the cause of the lumps and recommend the appropriate treatment.\n\nIf you are concerned about the lumps you are describing, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible. The doctor will perform a physical examination and may recommend additional tests, such as a biopsy (a procedure in which a small sample of tissue is taken and examined under a microscope), to determine the cause of the lumps.\n\nIt is important to note that it is not uncommon for people to have small, benign lumps in their neck, chest, or back.

Is it best - effort - if it is , how does it determine ' best effort ' ? Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"When a computer is running multiple processes at the same time, it needs to decide which process to work on first. The process that the computer chooses to work on first is called the \"scheduled\" or \"running\" process.\n\nThere are several ways that a computer can decide which process to schedule next. One way is to use a \"priority\" system, where each process is assigned a priority level, and the computer always schedules the process with the highest priority level first.\n\nAnother way is to use a \"time-sharing\" system, where each process is given a certain amount of time to run, and then the computer switches to another process. This helps to ensure that all processes get a fair amount of time to run, even if some processes have a higher priority level.\n\nThe \"best effort\" approach means that the computer will try its best to run all processes as quickly as possible, but it might not always be able to do so. For example, if there are a lot of processes running at the same time, the computer might not have enough resources (such as CPU or memory) to run all of them at the same speed. In this case, the computer might have to slow down some processes in order to keep others running smoothly.\n\nOverall, the way that a computer processes and schedules different processes is a very complex topic, and there are many different approaches that can be taken. However, the goal is always to make the best use of the computer's resources in order to get all of the processes done as efficiently as possible."}

They definitely clarify what I was trying to understand . Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"In more a scientific sense , entropy is a measure of the probability of certain states . Think of a glass of salt water , the most probable distribution of the water and salt molecules is that of an essentially even distribution throughout the glass . This would be considered a state of high entropy as it is very probable on a statistical level . Conversely , if all the salt and all the water were to spontaneously separate within the glass to form two distinct layers , there is far fewer distributions of the salt and water atoms that could lead to this state . This would be considered a low entropy system , as it is far less statistically probable . When it is said that isolated systems tent towards a state of higher entropy , it is because those states are more probable and therefore are more likely to occur . This is hard to explain much farther beyond this point without getting into thermodynamics and statistical mechanics . On a related note , one point I want to make is that entropy can decrease in a system that is not isolated . In the case of the earth , entropy of the earth is decreasing as we compartmentalize chemicals and form distinct organisms . This is possible because we 're being subjected to MASSIVE amounts of energy from the sun , which is then harnessed to go against the favorability of higher entropic states . The sun is gaining entropy by ejecting energy that we use to lower our entropy . If you 're interested in a more thorough explanation , this is a good introduction : URL_0"}

When you plug a speaker into an outlet, the electricity flows from the outlet, through the cord, and into the speaker. The speaker has a special component called an amplifier that takes the electricity and uses it to make the speaker cone move back and forth really fast, which creates sound waves that you can hear. The bigger the speaker is, the more electricity it might need to make the cone move fast enough to create really loud sound waves. But no matter how big the speaker is, it can still be powered by a normal outlet as long as it is not using more electricity than the outlet is able to provide."}

She is extremely flexible in the hips and has just now started doing an army low-crawl. What do you think is going on?","role":"user"}],"response":"It is normal for infants to develop the ability to support their own weight and stand upright at different ages. Most infants begin to pull themselves up to a standing position around 9-12 months of age and can stand unsupported around 12-15 months of age. However, every child is different and some may develop these skills earlier or later than others.\n\nThere are several factors that can affect an infant's ability to support their own weight and stand upright. These include muscle strength and coordination, balance, and overall physical development. Infants also need to learn how to use their muscles to control their movements and maintain their balance.\n\nIf your daughter is 9 months old and is having difficulty supporting her own weight and standing upright, it is possible that she simply needs more time to develop the necessary muscle strength and coordination. Encourage her to practice standing and moving around, but always supervise her to ensure that she is safe. If you are concerned about her development, it is always a good idea to consult with your pediatrician for further evaluation and guidance."}

Explain like I'm five.","role":"user"}],"response":"Gears control how much force your car can send to the wheels . If you want to accelerate rapidly , you want to be in a lower gear . The downside to low gears is that the engine spins very fast , and so you soon ca n't make the engine go any faster ( like cycling on a bike in a low gear when your legs go round as fast as they can , yet you do n't go very fast . ) In order to go at higher speeds , you need to shift into a higher gear . This means the engine can go at a lower speed ( RPM ) while the car goes at the same speed . Then accelerating speeds the engine back up , which thanks to the higher gear , results in a faster speed for the car . Lower gears are better for accelerating , Higher gears are better for having a higher top - speed . Higher gears are also more fuel efficient , since your engine wastes energy the faster it goes . If you are starting from stationary , you want to be in 1st gear , then as you accelerate to ~10 mph you will hear your engine start to whine as the RPM gets high , you should now change up to 2nd gear . Conversely if you are doing 70 mph on a motorway in 5th gear and slow down to 40pmh make a turning you are now in too high a gear for your speed , and the engine will struggle to accelerate . You should change down to 4th gear as you brake , so your car is ready to accelerate away afterwards . When going down a steep hill , you want to change down to a lower gear to keep your car from getting too fast . When going up hill , you also want a lower gear to provide more force to overcome gravity . Lower gear - > more resistance , more acceleration Higher gear - > less resistance , less acceleration"}

I will explain why difference memories need to have difference speeds . RAM and hard - drives work \" almost \" the same way , you store information there that you are going to use later . The only variables are \" time stored \" and \" access speed ( speed that the CPU gets the information ) \" . There are also SSD , that work the same way as Hard - Drives but are way faster ( and expensive as well ) . The major differences are that you can access RAM several times faster ( from 50 to 600 ) but the information on the RAM is lost when you turn the power off . So RAM is good to hold information you are working ( like videos that are playing , programs in execution , etc ) and Hard - Drives are good to store information for long times ( albums you \" downloaded \" , images , etc ) Think of that like : Hard - Drives are for storing information \" for ever \" .

It's made up of water, proteins, and various other substances. Its main job is to help keep the inside of your nose moist and to protect the delicate tissues in your nose from drying out or getting damaged. It also helps to keep out dirt, dust, and other particles that you don't want to inhale.\n\nWhen you have a cold or other respiratory illness, your body produces extra snot to help flush out germs and other substances that can make you sick. This is why you might have more snot when you're sick. It's also why your nose might feel stuffy or runny - the extra snot can clog up your nostrils and make it hard to breathe.\n\nSnot can be different colors, depending on what's going on in your body. It might be clear and watery, or it might be thicker and more yellow or green. This is usually just because of the different substances that are mixed in with the snot, and it doesn't necessarily mean that you're more or less sick.\n\nSo, in short, snot is a substance that helps keep your nose healthy and protects it from getting sick. It's completely normal to have some snot in your nose, and it's nothing to be worried about."}
